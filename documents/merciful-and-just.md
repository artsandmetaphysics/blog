If God _needed_ to send Jesus to be merciful and just when he condemns but forgives sinful humans, then God is bound by an external moral standard.

If God is the standard he would not need to send Jesus---he could have declared by the fact that he defines right and wrong, justice, and mercy that he both condemns sin and forgives us while also being merciful and just.

A natural response is to conclude that God didn't _need_ to send Jesus, but rather, he _wanted_ to.  Why did he want to?  If we say it is because he wanted to be merciful and just, then we are saying that God decided to follow an external moral standard.  But if he defines our moral standard, why did he want to follow a lesser, external standard?
