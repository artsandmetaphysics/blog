> The words of the Teacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.
> ~ (1.1)

The writer is not the same person as the Teacher.

> Vanity of vanities, says the Teacher,
>   vanity of vanities! All is vanity.
> What do people gain from all the toil
>   at which they toil under the sun?
> A generation goes, and a generation comes,
>   but the earth remains forever.
> The sun rises and the sun goes down,
>   and hurries to the place where it rises.
> The wind blows to the south,
>   and goes around to the north;
> round and round goes the wind,
>   and on its circuits the wind returns.
> All streams run to the sea,
>   but the sea is not full;
> to the place where the streams flow,
>   there they continue to flow.
> All things are wearisome;
>   more than one can express;
> the eye is not satisfied with seeing,
>   or the ear filled with hearing.
> What has been is what will be,
>   and what has been done is what will be done;
>   there is nothing new under the sun.
> Is there a thing of which it is said,
>   “See, this is new”?
> It has already been,
>   in the ages before us.
> The people of long ago are not remembered,
>   nor will there be any remembrance
> of people yet to come
>   by those who come after them.
> ~ (1.2--11)

In the most direct sense, the Teacher is wrong!

Our understanding of they physical world is more correct than that of ancient peoples. The Teacher, as most others in his time, believed that the water from the sea flowed back to the rivers through tunnels in the ground. The Earth itself will someday be destroyed when our sun explodes.

Ecclesiastes is thought to be written between 500 and 300 BCE. The Greeks invented many new ideas during these centuries---ideas that are still affecting the world today.

Since the invention of writing, we remember some famous people from long ago, for example, the king Hammurabi.

In a deeper sense, the Teacher is correct.

Most of us will not be remembered a few hundred years from now and perhaps 10,000 years from now Hammurabi will be less well known.

Perhaps humanity will continue to have new ideas and invent new technologies, but this "progress" will halt eventually. (It seems reasonable that there is a finite number of genuinely new ideas and phenomena for us to discover).

While the Teacher's understanding of physical reality was incomplete, it seems unlikely that an understanding of modern physics would alter his thinking.

Yet, in the deepest sense, I think the Teacher is wrong.

If our existence is meaningless because it is transient, or because it is not unique, then one must wonder where could meaning possibly come from? I think the only possible answers are that there must be meaning found even within our transient lives or that there is some mystical meta-physical source of meaning which is not found in our finite universe.

Thus, while our existence is but a breath, to be blown away and forgotten, we can find meaning in it or hope that there is a hidden meaning beyond the metaphysical veil.
