The word "meaning" has a few uses:

1. To what a word, text, symbols, actions or events convey, indicate, or refer
2. The significance or importance of something
3. The purpose or intent something

These uses appear related.

My wedding day was more meaningful than yesterday.  What makes some days more meaningful than others?  I believe the meaning of an event to an individual derives from the impact of that event on the individual.

My wedding was not meaningful to the caterers who patiently served my family that day.  Meaning is in the memory of the beholder and is therefore relative.

My great grandfathers met my great grandmothers, and begot those that begot those that begot me.  The moments of their meetings impacted me greatly, but I do not know anything about them, and they are not meaningful to me.  Many great inventions and ideas impact me daily, but are not meaningful to me.

Meaning is not synonymous with impact.  Meaning derives from our memories, and the impact of these memories.

Meaning is recursively derived.  For example, the meaning in my relationship with my wife is derived from the meaning of many days spent together.

Purpose is the reason for existence.  "Your chief purpose is to glorify God, and to enjoy him forever."  The purpose of a jar is to contain things, to make them easier to carry, or to make them easier to store.

Purpose is a relation between a creator and the created (or acquired).

When someone asks "what is my purpose," it may mean "for what purpose was I created?" or it may mean "what purpose should be behind the collective actions of my life?"  In the first case, God is the creator and the person is the created. In the second case the person is the creator and their actions are created.

- This meaning is relative.
- The meaning of things derives from the relative impact of those things.
- But meaning is not synonymous with impact.
- Purpose is proportional to providing meaning to others; does this even make sense?
- Is meaning morally neutral?
- Is the thing that no one remembers meaningless?
- The immortal gods keep meaning through their memories...
