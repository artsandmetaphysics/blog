## Observations

Herodotus's history of the Greco-Person war progresses back and forth in time as he gives background for the personalities and peoples involved.

Herodotus relays entertaining and implausible stories, occasionally mentioning that he doesn't believe them (and why) or offering his own alternative.  He is motivated by his major topic---the Greco-Persian Wars---but also by relaying marvels that he has found.  For example, he justifies his long discussion of Egypt as follows:

> I am going to extend my account of Egypt at some length here and give additional details about it, because this country has more marvels and monuments that defy description than any other.
> = (2.35)

His writing is conversational, and he does not have a strict sense of what sort of material belongs in his account and what does not.  I like this flexibility of scope, and I wish our 21st century expectations for topical boundaries were less rigidly followed.

Herodotus discusses

- Geography
- Customs of various peoples
- Debates about natural causes (the cause of the flood of the Nile)

Herodotus does not feel any need to outline the path he takes for his readers.  Whether this doing so was impractical using the writing technologies he had (i.e., he didn't know the path his writing would take, and could not insert an outline after the fact) or because he did not feel a need to pander to his listeners (or readers) is unclear.  In any event.

## Epistemology

> For of all the Egyptians, the Heliopolitans are said to be the most learned in tradition.  I have no desire to relate what I heard about matters concerning the gods, other than their names alone, since I believe that all people understand these things equally.  But when my discussion forces me to mention these things, I shall do so.  As to matters concerning the human world, they were in agreement.
> = (2.3--4)

> The Hellenes tell many different naive stories, and their myth of Herakles is especially foolish. 

## Religion

Herodotus was pious.

Herodotus believed that the Egyptians worshiped the same gods that the Greeks worshiped.  To a modern person, it seems more likely that the gods and their stories developed largely (but not completely_ independently.  Herodotus' willingness to associate foreign gods with Greek gods is consistent with the fact that he believed these gods existed and were present throughout the world.

## Quotes From Book I

The purpose of the book:

> Herodotus of Halicarnassus here displays his inquiry, so that human achievements may not become forgotten in time, and great and marvellous deeds---some displayed by Greeks, some by barbarians---may not be without their glory; and especially to show why the two peoples fought with each other.
> = (1.1)

Right and wrong were distinguished long ago:

> Gyges gave a cry of horror.  "Master," he said "what an improper suggestion!  Do you tell me to look at the queen when she has no clothes on?  No, no: 'when she takes off her clothing, she does away with her shame'---you know what they say of women.  Let us learn from experience.  Right and wrong were distinguished long ago---and I'll tell you one thing that is right: a man should mind his own business.  I do not doubt that your wife is the most beautiful of women; so for goodness' sake do not ask me to behave contrary to custom."
> = (1.8)

Solon's description of the happy life:

> When Solon had made as thorough an inspection [of the royal treasuries] as opportunity allowed, Croesus said: "Well, my Athenian friend, I have heard a great deal about your knowledge.  I cannot resist my desire to ask you a question: who is the happiest man you have ever seen?"
>
> The point of the question was that Croesus supposed himself to be the happiest of men.  Solon, however, refused to flatter, and answered in strict accordance with his view of the truth.  "An Athenian," he said, "called Tellus."
>
> Croesus was taken aback.  "And what," he asked sharply, "is your reason for this choice?"
>
> "There are good reasons," said Solon; "first, his city was prosperous, and he had fine sons, and lived to see children born to each of them, and all these children surviving; secondly, he had wealth enough by our standards; and he had a glorious death.  In a battle with the neighboring town of Eleusis, he fought for his countrymen, routed the enemy, and died like a brave man; and the Athenians paid him the high honor of a public funeral on the spot where he fell."  ...
>
> "I know God is envious of human prosperity and likes to trouble us; and you question me about the lot of man.  Listen then: as the years lengthen out, there is much both to see and to suffer which one would wish otherwise. ... You seem to be very rich, and you rule a numerous people; but the question you asked me I will not answer, until I know that you have died happily.  Great wealth can make a man no happier than moderate means, unless he has the luck to continue in prosperity to the end.  Many very rich men have been unfortunate, and many with moderate competence have had good luck.  The former are better off than the latter in two respects only, whereas the poor but lucky man has the advantage in many ways; for though the rich have the means to satisfy their appetites and to bear calamities, and the poor have not, the poor, if they are lucky, are more likely to keep clear of trouble, and will have besides the blessings of a sound body, health, freedom from trouble, fine children, and good looks."
> = (1.30--33)

Emigrating after a famine:

> There was still no remission of their suffering [from famine]---indeed it grew worse; so the King divided the population into two groups and determined by drawing lots which should emigrate and which should remain at home.  He appointed himself to rule the section whose lot determined that they should remain, and his son Tyrrhenus to command the emigrants.  The lots were drawn, and one section went down to the coast at Smyrna, where they built vessels, put aboard all their household effects and sailed in search of a livelihood elsewhere.
> = (1.94)

Persian customs:

> Of all days in the year a Persian most distinguishes his birthday, and celebrates it with a dinner of special magnificence.  A camel or a donkey baked whole in the oven and served up at table, and the poor some smaller beast.  The main dishes at their meals are few, but they have many sorts of dessert, the various courses being served separately.  It is this custom that has made them say that the Greeks leave the table hungry, because they never have anything worth mentioning after the first course: they think that if the Greeks did, they should go on eating.  They are very fond of wine, and no one is allowed to vomit or urinate in the presence of another person.
>
> If an important decision is to be made, they discuss the question when they are drunk, and the following day the master of the house where the discussion was held submits their decision for reconsideration when they are sober.  If they still approve it, it is adopted; if not, it is abandoned. ...
>
> No race is so ready to adopt foreign ways as the Persian; for instance, they wear the Median costume because they think it handsomer than their own, and their soldiers wear the Egyptian corslet.  Pleasures, too, of all sorts they are quick to indulge in when they get to know about them---a notable instance is pederasty, which they learned from the Greeks.  Every man has a number of wives, and a much greater number of concubines.  After prowess in fighting, the chief proof of manliness is to be the father of a large family of boys.  Those who have most sons receive an annual present from the king---on the principle that there is strength in numbers.  The period of a boy's education is between the ages of five and twenty, and they are taught three things only: to ride, to use the bow, and to speak the truth.  Before the age of five a boy lives with the women and never sees his father, the object being to spare the father distress if the child should die in the early stages of its upbringing.  In my view this is a sound practice.  I admire also the custom which forbids even the king himself to put a man to death for a single offense, and any Persian under similar circumstances to punish a servant by an irreparable injury.  Their way is to balance faults against services, and then, if the faults are greater and more numerous, anger may take its course.
> = (1.133--137)

Fate of the Lycians of Xanthus:

> The fate of the Lycians of Xanthus makes a different story.  When Harpagus advanced into the plain of Xanthus, they met him in battle, though greatly outnumbered, and fought with much gallantry; at length, however, they were defeated and forced to retire within their walls, whereupon they collected their women, children, slaves, and other property and shut them up in the citadel, set fire to it and burnt it to the ground.  Then having sworn to do or die, they marched out to meet the enemy and were killed to a man.
> = (1.176)

Babylonian engagement custom:

> In every village once a year all the girls of marriageable age used to be collected together in one place, while the men stood round them in a circle; an auctioneer then called each one in turn to stand up and offered her for sale, beginning with the best-looking and going on to the second best a soon as the first had been sold for a good price.  Marriage was the object of the transaction.  The rich men who wanted wives bid against each other for the prettiest girls, while the humbler folk, who had no use for good looks in a wife, were actually paid to take the ugly ones, for when the auctioneer had got through all the pretty girls he would call upon the plain ones, or even perhaps a crippled one, to stand up, and then ask who was willing to take the least money to marry her---and she was offered to whoever accepted the smallest sum.  The money came from the sale of the beauties, who in this way provided dowries for their ugly or misshapen sisters. ...
>
> This admirable practice has now fallen into disuse and they have of late years hit upon another scheme, namely the prostitution of all girls of the lower classes to provide some relief from the poverty which followed upon the conquest with its attendant hardship and general ruin.
> = (1.196)

Babylonian Aphrodite cult:

> There is one custom amongst the people which is wholly shameful: every woman who is a native of the country must once in her life go and sit in the temple of Aphrodite and there give herself to a strange man.  ... Once a woman has taken her seat she is not allowed to go home until a man has thrown a silver coin into her lap and taken her outside to lie with her.  As he throws the coin, the man has to say, "in the name of the goddess Mylitta"---that being the Assyrian name for Aphrodite.  The value of the coin is of no consequence; once thrown it becomes sacred, and the law forbids that it should ever be refused.  The woman has no privilege of choice---she must go with the first man who throws her the money.  When she has lain with him, her duty to the goddess is discharged and she may go home, after which it will be impossible to seduce her by any offer, however large.  Tall, handsome women soon manage to get home again, but the ugly ones stay a long time before they can fulfill the condition which the law demands, some of them, indeed, as much as three or four years.
> = (1.199)

Massagetae customs:

> Every man has a wife, but all wives are used promiscuously.  If a man wants a woman, all he does is to hang up his quiver in front of her wagon and then enjoy her without misgiving.  They have one way only of determining the appropriate time to die, namely this: when a man is very old, all his relatives give a party and include him in a general sacrifice of cattle; then they boil the flesh and eat it.  This they consider to be the best sort of death.  Those who die of disease are not eaten but buried, and it is held a misfortune not to have lived long enough to be sacrificed.  They have no agriculture, but live on meat and fish, of which  there is an abundant supply in the Araxes.  They are milk-drinkers.  The only god they worship is the sun, to which they sacrifice horses: the idea behind this is to offer the swiftest of mortal creatures to the swiftest of the gods.
> = (1.216)

## Quotes From Book II

The account of why the Egyptians came to believe the Phrygians were the oldest men:

> Now, before Psammetichos became king, the Egyptians used to believe that they were the earliest humans.  But upon assuming the kingship Psammetichos became eager to ascertain which people were really the first; and ever since his reign, the Egyptians consider that the Phrygians lived before they did, but that they themselves existed prior to all the rest of humanity.  Unable to find a means of discovering who were the first humans by making inquiries, Psammetichos devised an experiment.  He selected two newborn children from ordinary people and gave them to a shepherd to take into his flocks and raise according to the following instructions: no one was to utter a word in their presence; the shepherd should place them in a secluded hut by themselves and at appropriate intervals bring in the goats, give the children their fill of milk, and then tend to the rest of their needs. The reason he gave these instructions was because he wished to listen to the children after they had outgrown their inarticulate crying and to find out what word they would speak first.  And everything turned out as he planned, for the shepherd had followed his orders for two years when one day, as he opened the door entering, both children rushed at him with outstretched hands, crying out "bekos." At first the shepherd kept quiet about having heard this, but when the word bekos was repeated again and again as he came and went in his care for the children, he told his master.  At his command the shepherd brought the children into his presence, and Psammetichos himself heard the word.  When he inquired which people might use the word bekos, he discovered that the word bekos means "bread" in the Phrygian language.  Thus the Egyptians accepted this evidence and concluded that the Prygians are older than themselves.
> = (2.2)

Whether or not the Egyptians believed this account or performed this experiment, it seems clear that some group (be it Herodotus or his listeners) found this account plausible.  There is a certain logic to the argument, and it also demonstrates the basic conception of performing an "experiment" to learn about the natural world.  They assume that language is innate, and that a child would innately begin speaking the first language.  They also don't seem to consider that the children could have, by chance, made up a word that matched an existing language.

Herodotus seems to believe the world is quite old:

> Now then, if the Nile's flow were diverted into this Arabian gulf, what would prevent it from filling up the gulf with silt in 20,000 years?  For my part, I suppose it might fill it up with silt in only 10,000 years.  Well, then, given all the years that passed before I was born, why could not a gulf much larger than this have been silted up by a river as great and powerful as the Nile?
> = (2.11)

In several places in Herodotus, it seems the Greeks (in this case the Ionians) wanted to believe the world was innately symmetrical and ordered.  Thus, they want to believe there is a clean division between the continents.

> Now, if my understanding of these matters is correct, then the Ionians' conception of Egypt is absurd, and even if their view of Egypt were correct, their simple arithmetic would be all wrong! For when they claim that the whole earth is made up of three parts---Europe, Asia, and Libya---they in fact should add the Delta of Egypt as a fourth part. Indeed, by their own definition, the Nile is what divides Asia and Libya; but the fact is that the Nile splits and flows around the Delta from its apex, so that the Delta itself lies between Asia and Libya.
> Let me dismiss the view of the Ionians now and instead describe to you my own opinions on these matters. I believe it best to characterize Egypt as all the territory inhabited by Egyptians, just as Cilicia is populated by Cilicians and Assyria by the Assyrians; and as we have seen, there are no boundaries between Asia and Libya other than the boundaries of the land which is inhabited by the Egyptians.
> = (2.16--17)

Herodotus argues that there are not geometrically pure boundaries, and perhaps that it is better to recognize that Egypt is better defined by where the Egyptians are.  This conception is more consistent with my own---words are often vague, recursive representations of patterns, such as "where the Egyptians are."  But I may be misunderstanding Herodotus, because in the next fragment, he presents an argument using an oracle from Ammon, which may refute my understanding of what he says.  Perhaps I am applying a 21st century expectations to him.

A fun passage discussing the cause of the Nile's flooding:

> Certain Hellenes, however, wanting to win fame for their cleverness, have expressed three different explanations concerning this river ...
> The second explanation is even less knowledgeable than the one just mentioned and, if I may say so, more astonishing.  Its claim is that the Nile causes this phenomenon because it flows from Ocean, and that Ocean flows around the entire world.
> The third theory, though ostensibly much more plausible, is in fact the most erroneous.  Indeed, this theory makes no sense at all when it claims that the Nile's flood comes from melting snow which flows from the interior of Libya through the middle of Ethiopia and then issues forth into Egypt.  Well, now, how could flood come from melting snow if its water flows from the warmest regions to those which are for the most part cooler? A man could at least try to think logically about such things ... [Herodotus gives various arguments against this second theory]
> And the man who spoke of Ocean, transporting his story into the realm of the unknown, cannot possibly be refuted. For I, at least, have no certain knowledge that such a river Ocean exists; I think, rather, that Homer or one of the poets before him invented the name and introduced it into his poetry.
> If one were to say, however, that after finding fault with the opinions already proposed about the unknown, one should declare his own ideas, I shall reveal to you why I think the Nile floods in summer.  I believe that during the winter the sun is driven off its usual course by storms and travels to the region of the sky above Libya.
> = (2.20--23)

As in the story about Psammetichos' experiment, it seems that rational and empirical explanations are being pursued.  I especially like how Herodotus dismisses the second argument since it is not refutable, and then conjectures that a poet made it up.

A bizarre story about cats:

> Many animals live with these people, but many more would do so if it were not for the fate of the cats.  When the female cats have given birth, they no longer associate with the males, who, however, still seek intercourse with them, but without success.  So in response, the males outsmart the females by stealing away and then killing their offspring, although they do not eat them after killing them.  The females, bereft of their babies, feel a desire foe more and so go back to the males, for they are fond of offspring.
> And whenever a fire breaks out, some divine seizure comes over the cats.  The Egyptians stand at intervals and try to keep the cats safe, but if they fail to extinguish the fire, the cats slip between or leap over them and rush into the flames.  When this happens, the Egyptians are overcome by intense grief.  All those who live in a household where a cat has died a natural death shave their eyebrows.  For the death of a dog, however, they shave their entire body and head.
