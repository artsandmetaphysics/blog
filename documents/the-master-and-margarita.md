## Characters

**Mikhail Alexandrovich Berlioz** is the short, dark-haired, plump, bald editor of a literary journal and chairman of the board of Massolit.

**Ivan Nikolaevich Ponyrev** is a young, broad-shouldered poet who writes under the pseudonym Homeless.

**Koroviev**, or the choirmaster, or also Fagott, is Wooland's henchman; seven feet tall and unbelievably thin, he has a jeering face.

**Wooland** is satan. His left teeth have platinum crowns, his right have gold, his right eye is black, his left green, he has dark hair and appears to be a little over 40.

**Yeshua Ha-Nozri**, Wooland's depiction of Jesus.  Yeshua is Aramaic for "Lord of Salvation" and Ha-Nozri means "of Nazareth."

**The Giant Cat** is Wooland's companion.

**Riukhin** is Homeless's friend and a phony poet, who tries to help him at the clinic but is rejected.

**Stepan Bogdanovich Likhodeev**, or Styopa for short, is the director of the Variety Theatre, and Berlioz's roommate.

**The Redhead** is a wooland companion; he is short but extraordinarily broad-shouldered; he wears a bowler hat, has flaming red hair, a fang, and is quite ugly.

**Doctor Stravinksy** is the friendly psychiatrist at the country hospital.

**Nikanor Ivanovich Bosoy** is the chairman of the tenants' association where Berlioz and Styopa lived.

**Grigory Danilovich Rimsky** is the financial directory (findirector) of the Variety Theater.

**Varenukha** is the administrator of the Variety Theater.

**Georges Bengalsky** is the master of ceremonies for the Variety Theater.

**The Master** is a writer, who wrote a book about Pontius Pilate and subsequently went insane.  At the time when Ivan meets him, he is a "clean shaven, dark-haired man of approximately thirty-eight, with a sharp nose, anxious [brown] eyes, and a wisp of hair hanging down on his forehead."

## Motif: Reactions to the Supernatural

Satan visits Moscow and accomplishes his plans with many supernatural feats. The book explores how individuals react to these events, and in particular the nature of denial and belief.

The opening discussion, between the editor Berlioz, the poet Ivan, and the Satan, is regarding the existence of Jesus.  After some back and forth, Satan says:

> "Bear in mind that Jesus did exist."
> "You see, Professor," Berlioz responded with a forced smile, "we respect your great learning, but on this question we hold to a different point of view."
> "There's no need for any points of view," the strange professor replied, "he simply existed, that's all."
> "But there's need for some proof ..." Berlioz began.
> "There's no need for any proofs," replied the professor, and he began to speak softly ..."
> = (p. 14)

And then Satan tells the story of Jesus' trial before Pilate.

Later on in the story, Ivan is in insane asylum discussing his encounter with Satan with another inmate:

> "Very well," the visitor replied, and he said weightily and distinctly: "Yesterday at the Patriarch's Ponds you met Satan."
> Ivan did not get upset, as he had promised, but even so he was greatly astounded.
> "That can't be! He doesn't exist!"
> "Good heavens! Anyone else might say that, but not you.  You were apparently one of his first victims. You're sitting, as you yourself understand, in a psychiatric clinic, yet you keep saying he doesn't exist.  Really, it's strange!"
> "... And, really, I'm surprised at Berlioz! Now you, of course, are a virginal person," here the guest apologized again, "but that one, from what I've heard about him, had after all read at least something!"
> = (p. 133)

Many other characters struggle to reconcile the supernatural events with their reason.  The findirector Rimsky, upon receiving telegrams from Styopa who had been in Moscow that morning but was transported by Satan across Russian to Yalta, searches for possible explanations:

> The findirector's position was very difficult. It was necessary at once, right on the spot, to invent ordinary explanations for extraordinary phenomena.

And later that evening, during Wooland's first séance, the master of ceremonies expresses a common response to the supernatural:

> "... And so, now comes the famous foreign artiste, Monseiur Woland, with a séance of black magic. Well, both you and I know," here Bengalsky smiled a wise smile, "that there's no such thing in the world, and that it's all just superstition, and Maestro Woland is simply a perfect master of the technique of conjuring, as we shall see from the most interesting part, that is, the exposure of the technique"
> = (p. 119)

and, after a couple very impressive "magic tricks," including a rain of cash from the ceiling:

> "Here, citizens, you and I have just beheld a case of so-called mass hypnosis. A purely scientific experiment, proving in the best way possible that there are no miracles in magic.  Let us ask Maestro Woland to expose this experiment for us.  Presently, citizens, you will see these supposed banknotes disappear as suddenly as they appeared."
> Here he applauded, but quite alone, while a confident smile played on his face, yet in his eyes there was no such confidence, but rather an expression of entreaty.
> = (p. 122)

Shortly after, Satan has his cat cut off Bengalsky's head (it is put back on later).

## Quotes

Our two writers drink a soda:

> "Give us seltzer," Berlioz asked.
> "There is no seltzer," the woman in the stand said, and for some reason became offended.
> "Is there beer?" Homeless inquired in a rasping voice.
> "Beer'll be delivered towards evening," the woman replied.
> "Then what is there?" asked Berlioz.
> "Apricot soda, only warm," said the woman.
> "Well, let's have it, let's have it! ..."
> The soda produced an abundance of yellow foam, and the air began to smell of a barber-shop. Having finished drinking, the writers immediately started to hiccup, paid, and sat down on a bench face to the pond and back to Bronnaya.
> = (p. 3)

The foreigner describes the process of getting lung-cancer:

> "You are no longer interested in anyone's fate but your own. Your family starts lying to you. Feeling that something is wrong, you rush to learned doctors, then to quacks, and sometimes to fortune-tellers as well. Like the first, so the second and third are completely senseless, as you understand. And it all ends tragically: a man who still recently thought he was governing something, suddenly winds up lying motionless in a wooden box, and the people around him, seeing that the man lying there is no longer good for anything, burn him in an oven."
> = (p. 10)

Yeshua, explaining to Pontius Pilate that he did not incite the Jews to destroy the temple:

> "These good people ... haven't any learning and have confused everything I told them.  Generally, I'm beginning to be afraid that this confusion may go on for a very long time.  And all because he writes down the things I say incorrectly."
> = (p. 19)

Bulgakov's interpolation of John 18:38, when Pilate asks Jesus "What is Truth?":

> "And why did you stir up the people in the bazaar, you vagrant, talking about the truth, of which you have no notion? What is truth?"
> And here the procurator thought: "Oh, my gods! I'm asking him about something unnecessary at a trial ... my reason no longer serves me ..." And again he pictured a cup of dark liquid. "Poison, bring me poison..."
> And again he heard the voice:
> "The truth is, first of all, that your head aches, and aches so badly that you're having faint-hearted thoughts of death. You're not only unable to speak to me, but it is even hard for you to look at me.  And I am now your unwilling torturer, which upsets me.  You can't even think about anything and only dream that your dog should come, apparently the one being you are attached to. But your suffering will soon be over, your headache will go away."
> = (p. 21)

Bulgakov's disdain for the mystics:

> But no, no! The seductive mystics are lying, there are no Caribbean Seas in the world, no desperate freebooters sail them, no corvette chases after them, no cannon smoke drifts across the waves.  There is nothing, and there was nothing! There is that sickly linden over there, there is the cast-iron fence, and the boulevard beyond it ... And the ice is melting in the bowl, and at the next table you see someone's bloodshot, bovine eyes, and you're afraid, afraid ... Oh, gods, my gods, poison, bring me poison! ...
> = (p. 58)

Bulgakov's describes how Berlioz's death is received:

> Yes, he's dead, dead ... But, we, we're alive!
> Yes, a wave of grief billowed up, held out for a while, but then began to subside, and somebody went back to his table and---sneakily at first, then openly---drank a little vodka and ate a bite. And, really, can one let chicken cutlets de volaille perish? How can we help Mikhail Alexandrovich? By going hungry? But, after all, we're alive!
> = (p. 59)

The various schemes to get Berlioz's living space:

> The news of Berlioz's death spread through the whole house with a sort of supernatural speed, and as of seven o'clock Thursday morning, Bosoy began to receive telephone calls and then personal visits with declarations containing claims to the deceased's living space.  In the period of two hours, Nikanor Ivanovich received thirty-two such declarations.
> They contained pleas, threats, libels, denunciations, promises to do renovations at their expense, references to unbearable over-crowding and the impossibility of living in the same apartment with bandits. Among others there were a description, staggering in its artistic power, of the theft from the apartment no. 31 of some meat dumplings, tucked directly into the pocket of a suit jacket, two vows to end life by suicide and one confession of secret pregnancy.
> = (p. 92)
