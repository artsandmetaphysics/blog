Are beautiful words more likely to be true than plain words?

The relationship between beauty and truth is not fundamental, but emerges from how we acquire knowledge from others. Often, we don't have the time, inclination, or ability to acquire knowledge directly. For example, if unable evaluate a lawyer's ability, we rely on a recommendation. Thus, we use other people's beliefs to help us arrive at our own.

We don't follow blindly. To decide whether someone is malicious or mistaken, we consider their motives and expertise. We trust the astronomy professor's claim about Jupiter's moons more than your uncle's. If a person has been right before, we believe them more easily.  We trust ten people more than two. It is this last knowledge-gathering heuristic that produces the indirect connection between beauty and truth.

Beauty gets attention, becomes widespread, and gathers authority. An author's words are beautiful, so they are repeated. Decades pass, and the words become ubiquitous. Eventually, they become authoritative. Many will question and disagree---but most will not have the time to critique the author's words, and will put faith in its ubiquity.

Homer's _Iliad_ is beautiful, and for many centuries Greek and Roman thinkers, many attacking the poet as a liar, conceived of the world and the gods in the terms he used.
