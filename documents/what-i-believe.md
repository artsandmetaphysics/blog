  A summary of my beliefs

In this essay I will attempt to summarize my most important beliefs.  In particular, I will provide an answer to these three questions:

How do we know?
What is the nature of reality?
How should we act?

I once believed that these questions were somehow fundamental, and that their answers built cleanly upon each other.  According to this reasoning, we first determine how to know things.  Then use this ability to determine the nature of reality.  Finally, we deduce from the nature of reality how we should act.

I now believe that these three questions are not fundamental.  What does it mean to be "fundamental"?  Well, to be the most basic questions---the answers to any other questions would somehow build on the answers to these fundamental three.

I also believe that the answers to the first and second question are intertwined.
