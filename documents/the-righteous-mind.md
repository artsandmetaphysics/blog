## Summary

## Outline

- Intuitions come first; strategic reasoning second
  - Where does morality come from?
    - Nativist: It is innate (biology or God)
    - Empiricist: From observations or experience; taught by parents and society
    - Rationalist: Self-taught from observations, and especially that the child doesn't like to be harmed
    - Intuitionism: Moral "tastebuds" are innate; society teaches us what "tastes good"
  - Models of the Mind
    - Plato: Reason could and should be master
    - Hume: Reason should serve the "passions"
    - Jefferson: Reason and emotions are equally good
  - Evidence that intitutions come first
  - Evidence that strategic reasoning comes second
- There's more to morality than harm and fairness

## Questions

What is the precise difference between moral rationalism and empiricism?

Certainly the empiricist is allowed to use reason to develop their morality? Perhaps the distinction is that the empiricist believes we merely follow the patterns set by the humans around us, while the rationalist uses first-principles to derive morality.

Rationalism and empiricism would then be gradations on a spectrum. The rationalist uses observations and experience, as well as reason.

## The Rationalist Delusion

At first Haidt seemed to agree with Hume that reason _ought_ to serve emotions.  This interpretation is strengthed by his use of the term the "rationalist delusion."  But I think Haidt does _not_ believe reason should serve the emotions.  Instead, he is skeptical of the individual's ability to reason, but ultimately reason is still king.

At the end of Book I, Haidt presents his most compelling arguments against the rationalist view of the mind (and moral thinking):

> Anyone who values truth should stop worshipping reason. We all need to take a cold hard look at the evidence and see reasoning for what it is ... most of the bizarre and depressing research findings make perfect sense once you see reasoning as having evolved not to help us find truth but to help us engage in arguments, persuasion, and manipulation in the context of discussions with other people ... ”This explains why the confirmation bias is so powerful, and so ineradicable. How hard could it be to teach students to look on the other side, to look for evidence against their favored view? Yet, in fact, it’s very hard, and nobody has yet found a way to do it. It’s hard because the confirmation bias is a built-in feature (of an argumentative mind), not a bug that can be removed (from a platonic mind).
>
> I’m not saying we should all stop reasoning and go with our gut feelings. Gut feelings are sometimes better guides than reasoning for making consumer choices and interpersonal judgments, but they are often disastrous as a basis for public policy, science, and law. Rather, what I’m saying is that we must be wary of any individual’s ability to reason. We should see each individual as being limited, like a neuron. A neuron is really good at one thing: summing up the stimulation coming into its dendrites to “decide” whether to fire a pulse along its axon. A neuron by itself isn’t very smart. But if you put neurons together in the right way you get a brain; you get an emergent system that is much smarter and more flexible than a single neuron.

> In the same way, each individual reasoner is really good at one thing: finding evidence to support the position he or she already holds, usually for intuitive reasons. We should not expect individuals to produce good, open-minded, truth-seeking reasoning, particularly when self-interest or reputational concerns are in play. But if you put individuals together in the right way, such that some individuals can use their reasoning powers to disconfirm the claims of others, and all individuals feel some common bond or shared fate that allows them to interact civilly, you can create a group that ends up producing good reasoning as an emergent property of the social system. This is why it’s so important to have intellectual and ideological diversity within any group or institution whose goal is to find truth (such as an intelligence agency or a community of scientists) or to produce good public policy (such as a legislature or advisory board). And if our goal is to produce good behavior, not just good thinking, then it’s even more important to reject rationalism and embrace intuitionism.

The evidence presented in part one highlights how difficult it is for individual reasoning to find truth.  In this quote, Haidt presents his alternative method---diverse groups civilly debating one another.  This alternative method of truth-finding appeals to me; many of my most productive intellectual developments stem from conversations.

This passage implies that the individual reasoner _can_ arrive at the truth in some cases, especially when within a diverse and civil group. Afterall, the individuals must be able to accept the external arguments which are most true.  If they can't, how could the group arrive at the truth?

Haidt anticipates this tension when he says:

> I have tried to make a reasoned case that our moral capacities are best described from an intuitionist perspective. I do not claim to have examined the question from all sides, nor to have offered irrefutable proof. Because of the insurmountable power of the confirmation bias, counterarguments will have to be produced by those who disagree with me. Eventually, if the scientific community works as it is supposed to, the truth will emerge as a large number of flawed and limited minds battle it out.
> - (p. 107)

All skeptics of individual reasoning face this contradiction when they reason.

Haidt focuses on morality, politics, and psychology, fields where truth is ambiguous and our individual bias are profound.  These biases are less problematic in other fields, such as math and physics, where reality more immediatly tempers our biases.

> I have argued that the Humean model (reason is a servant) fits the facts better than the Platonic model (reason could and should rule) or the Jeffersonian model (head and heart are co-emperors). But when Hume said that reason is the “slave” of the passions, I think he went too far ... When does the elephant listen to reason? The main way that we change our minds on moral issues is by interacting with other people. We are terrible at seeking evidence that challenges our own beliefs, but other people do us this favor, just as we are quite good at finding errors in other people’s beliefs. When discussions are hostile, the odds of change are slight. The elephant leans away from the opponent, and the rider works frantically to rebut the opponent’s charges. But if there is affection, admiration, or a desire to please the other person, then the elephant leans toward that person and the rider tries to find the truth in the other person’s arguments. The elephant may not often change its direction in response to objections from its own rider, but it is easily steered by the mere presence of friendly elephants (that’s the social persuasion link in the social intuitionist model) or by good arguments given to it by the riders of those friendly elephants (that’s the reasoned persuasion link).

Haidt uses "reason" to mean an individual brain's flawed "ability to reason," not the abstract conceptualization of reason as a pure good thing.

To see why this distinction is important, imagine a biased partisan searching for evidence to affirm their party's position.  In one sense this individual is "reasoning"---he is using the reasoning part of his mind.  In another sense, they are only reasoning in proportion to their ability to find the truth.  (... but on further consideration, if we define "reason" to be "the path towards truth," then it is a useless definition ... I think Haidt's definition of the term reason is actually more appropriate ...)

Haidt's skepticism towards reason is less radical that it first seems---it seems that he agrees with Plato that abstract reason _should_ be king, but that individuals are not goo

## What is Reason?

What does Haidt mean by "reason?"  To begin, lets assume he means what is normally meant.  What is normally meant by the word "reason?"

Sometimes the word is used as a noun.  For example, "my reason for moving to New York."  Here the "reason" is the result of "reasoning."  It is the output of a process.  "A cause, explanation, or justification for an action or event."

The word "reason" is also used as a verb.  To "reason" is to "think, understand, and form judgments by a process of logic."

The reasoning process varies with the task. Consider:

- Solving a mathematics problem
- Designing a physics experiment
- Modeling weather systems
- Deducing the conclusions of a psychology experiment
- Deciding whether to hire a particular individual
- Predicting the effects of law on society

It surprises me that so many varied actives are considered "reasoning."  The processes that are followed by a mathematician and a politician are quite different. 

Good reasoning tends to lead to true judgments.  But even reasoning which leads to false judgments may be "good" in the sense that the conclusions drawn were the most likely given the evidence available.

## Does Education make us Moral?

I suspect it does, but why?
