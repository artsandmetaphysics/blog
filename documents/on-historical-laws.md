Some philosophers think history is not philosophically interesting, since historians can not provide laws, or law-like explanations, and thus their inferences can not be rationally evaluated.

I take "law" to mean a universally true, conditional statement about reality. By requiring a law to be a _conditional_ statement, we distinguish it from particular statements like "Julius Caesar was murdered on the 15th of March, 44 BC."

I agree that the historian, like the social scientist, can not produces laws. This is to be expected, since their objects of study---people, emotions, nations, wars, governments, etc.---are too complex to universally define, let alone deduce universally true conditional statements about.

Even if one agrees the historian can not produces laws, one may believe they exist. I hope to demonstrate that historical laws---laws dealing with historical objects, such as nations---can not exist. Furthermore, despite this epistemic limitation of history, it remains useful and "philosophically interesting."

Consider this law: When a ruling power's dominance is threatened by the quickly growing power of a neighbor, the two entities will go to war. This, like all simple attempts at historical laws, isn't universally true. There are exceptions which do not follow the rule. These exceptions may be addressed with conditions, such as "when the existing nation isn't distracted by other wars." It may be possible, after adding three or four such conditions, to make the law fit all available historical examples. Yet there is no reason to believe it is now universally true.

Historical events, even as important as wars, can be caused by individuals. For example, it is not implausible that a dictatorship may go to war with their smaller neighbor because of a few molecules in the supreme leader's brain at a critical moment.

The objects the historian studies, like the words of languages, are complex patterns formed by particles in time and space. Water molecules are well-defined pattern. A cup is less well-defined, yet more so than a person. The concept of a nation, or a war, are patterns built on patterns, layered recursively like the words of our language. Like the words of our language, they compress away the overwhelming detail of the particular objects, allowing our limited minds to operate and comprehend reality at a higher level of abstraction.

The compressive and lossy nature of our descriptions of these objects, which make them useful to the human mind, precludes the existence of historical laws. Any law whose objects are imprecise patterns of particles will fail to be true in every instance; there will be exceptional cases, when a "nation" or "person" is an outlier, where the details lost in our descriptions will be important.

One may attempt to avoid this conclusion by identifying larger systems whose behavior could be predicted with absolute certainty without knowledge of their inner workings. We refer to such a system as a _black box_. The laws of physics seem to preclude the existence of true black boxes. There are, however, systems that can be described as statistical black boxes. For example, we may amply explain and predict the behavior of a glass of water using a handful of numbers---e.g., its temperature and volume. Statistical black boxes may appear to reopen the possibility of historical laws, however, humans are interesting precisely because they are not like such simple systems! Without being pulled into questions of freewill and determinism, we can conclude that to predict human behavior with the precision required by a universally true law, we would need a full description of the particles constituting that human.

If God were to extend our simplistic example of a historical law, by reviewing all the wars and possible wars in history and adding appropriate conditionals, the resulting law would be similar to our physical laws! In other words, the complexity and enormity of the exceptional cases produced could not be succinctly stated in terms of terms of historical objects, but only in terms of the particles that constitute these historical objects.

Thus we must abandon the belief in the existence of laws operating on historical objects. The imprecision inerrant in the very words used by the historian precludes absolute certainty.

We may now consider the second part of the original statement, that laws or law-like explanations necessary for something to be rationally evaluated.

Business books are a practical, and widely used, form of historical knowledge.  Many overly generalize their claims, yet it is unlikely that the books are entirely useless since so many business people make decisions based on them. Likewise, governments and militaries rely heavily on historical analysis.

If one defines "rationally evaluable" so as to preclude these uses of history in business, government, and the military, it would seem that the realm of philosophy is inappropriately reduced. The desire for the level of precision found in mathematics and the hard sciences, is understandable. But by relegating oneself to these tidier fields of inquiry the philosopher avoids the big questions---of people, values, governments, and war---which are the most interesting.

The claim investigated in this essay is not unlike the one, made by some philosophers, that only statements verifiable through direct observation or logical proof are meaningful. It is tempting to make such claims when confronting the messy nature of reality and language, but doing so erodes credibility when our everyday reality continually provides evidence of the utility and interest of history.

The historically-minded philosopher must settle with sketches, observations, heuristics, and other weaker epistemological devices, while continuing to apply them to the large questions of human existence.
