  Is history philosophically uninteresting because it can not provide universal laws?

Some philosophers think history is uninteresting because it can not provide laws, or law-like explanations, and thus its inferences can't be rationally evaluated.

I agree that the historian, like the social scientist, can not produces laws. By law I mean a universally true, conditional statement about reality. (Defining a law to be a _conditional_ statement distinguishes it from particular statements like "Julius Caesar was murdered on the 15th of March, 44 BC.") The objects of historical study---people, nations, wars, governments, etc.---are too complex to universally define, let alone deduce universally true conditional statements about.

Even if one agrees that the historian can not produces laws, one may believe they exist. I hope to demonstrate that historical laws---laws dealing with historical objects, such as nations---can not exist. Furthermore, despite this epistemic limitation of history, it remains useful, open to rational evaluation, and philosophically interesting.

Consider this law: When a ruling power's dominance is threatened by a growing neighbor, they will go to war. This, like all simple attempts at historical laws, isn't universally true. There are instances of nations peacefully eclipsing their once-dominant neighbors. These exceptions may be addressed with conditions, such as "when the existing nation isn't distracted by other wars." It may be possible, after adding three or four such conditions, to make the law fit all available historical examples. Yet there is no reason to believe it is now universally true.

Since historical events can be caused by individuals, it is necessary for a historical law to fully predict an individual's behavior.  For example, a nation may go to war with a smaller neighbor because of a few molecules in their supreme leader's brain. Or two nuclear powers may avoid war only because of the calm reasoning of a missile operator. These extreme examples must be accounted for by a universally true law.

The objects the historian studies, like the words of languages, are complex patterns formed by particles in time and space. Water molecules are well-defined pattern. A cup is less well-defined, yet more so than a person. The concept of a nation, or a war, are patterns built on patterns, layered recursively like the definitions in a dictionary. Words compress the overwhelming detail needed for complete descriptions, allowing our minds to operate in reality at a higher level of abstraction.

The compressive and lossy nature of words preclude the existence of historical laws. Any law whose objects are imprecise patterns of particles will fail to be true in every instance; since the words used to state the law have already blurred out the details necessary to make conclusive predictions.

To avoid this conclusion one must identify larger objects whose behavior could be predicted with certainty without knowledge of their constituent particles. We refer to such a system as a _black box_. The laws of physics preclude the existence of black boxes.

There are, however, systems that can be described as statistical black boxes. For example, we may explain and predict the some behavior of a glass of water using a few of numbers---e.g., its temperature and volume. Humans, however, certainly can not be reduced to such simple system! Without being pulled into questions of freewill and determinism, we can conclude that to predict human behavior with the precision required by a universally true law, we would need detailed knowledge of the particles constituting that human.

If God were to extend our example of a historical law, by reviewing all the wars and possible wars between neighboring powers and amending it with conditionals until it were universally true, the result would be similar to the physical laws of nature! The complexity and enormity of the conditionals produced could not be succinctly stated in terms of terms of historical objects, but only by referencing their constituent particles. Thus, we must abandon any belief in the existence of historical laws.

We may now consider whether laws, or law-like explanations, are necessary for something to be rationally evaluated.

Business books are a practical, and widely used, form of historical knowledge.  The conclusions of such books are not universally true (and many are simply incorrect), yet collectively they are not useless. Otherwise, business people would not continue making decisions based on them. Likewise, governments and militaries rely heavily on historical analysis.

If one defines "rationally evaluable" so as to preclude these uses of historical knowledge in business, government, and the military, it would seem that the realm of philosophy is inappropriately reduced. The desire for the level of precision found in mathematics and the hard sciences is understandable, but by relegating oneself to these tidier fields of inquiry the philosopher avoids the big questions---of people, values, governments, and war---which are most interesting.

(In addition to producing generalized knowledge, the particulars of history form the identity of nations and peoples. Thus, some historical knowledge is necessary to understand human behavior and to appreciate the beauty of our literature and art.)

The claim investigated in this essay is not unlike the one, made by some philosophers, that only statements verifiable through direct observation or logical proof are meaningful. It is tempting to make such claims when confronting the messy nature of reality and language, but doing so erodes credibility when our everyday reality continually provides evidence of the utility and interest of history.

The philosopher must settle with sketches, observations, heuristics, and other weaker epistemological devices that history provides, while continuing to apply them to the large questions of human existence.
