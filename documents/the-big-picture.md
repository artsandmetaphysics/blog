## Part One: Cosmos

Carroll is a proponent of poetic naturalism.  Naturalism comes down to three things:

1. There is only one world, the natural world.
2. The world evolves according to unbroken patterns, the laws of nature.
3. The only reliable way of learning about the world is by observing it.

The poetic aspect comes to the fore when we start talking about the world.  It can also be summarized in three points:

1. There are many ways of talking about the world.
2. All good ways of talking must be consistent with one another and with the world.
3. Our purposes in the moment determine the best way of talking.

Carrol's discussion of determinism provides an example of how poetic naturalism works:

> Perhaps Laplace's greatest contribution to our understanding of mechanics was not a technical or mathematical advance, but a philosophical one.  He realized that there was a simple answer to the question "What determines what will happen next?" And the answer is "The state of the universe right now." ...
>
> We know that the quantum state of a system, left alone, evolves in a perfectly deterministic fashion, free even of the rare but annoying examples of non-determinism that we can find in classical mechanics.  But when we *observe* a system, it seems to behave randomly, rather than deterministically. ...

> The momentary or Laplacian nature of physical evolution doesn't have much relevance for the choices we face in our everyday lives.  For poetic naturalism, the situation is clear.  There is one way of talking about the universe that describes it as elementary particles or quantum states, in which Laplace holds sway and what happens next depends only on the state of the system right now.  There is also another way of talking about it, where we zoom out a bit and introduce categories like "people" and "choices."  Unlike our best theory of planets or pendulums, our best theories of human behavior are not deterministic.  We don't know any way to predict what a person will do based on what we can readily observe about their current state.  Whether we think of human behavior as determined depends on what we know.

Carroll doesn't pursue this determinism as far as I would like.  The concept of the "system" and the "surroundings" are useful for modeling reality and writing equations for small parts of it, but they are just words we use in our models.  Thus, what does it mean to say the system is deterministic except when you observe it?  We want to know whether the entire universe is deterministic or not.  If there are parts of the universe that are not deterministic, even only occasionally when we "observer" them, then then entire universe is not deterministic.  Determinism is an all-or-nothing phenomena.

Could we consider the entire universe as "the system," such that there is no outside observer who could introduce randomness by "collapsing the wave function"?  If this is possible then why does the act of dividing the universe into system and surroundings introduce randomness?  It would appear that it can not.

My conclusion, as a non-expert, is that we do not know whether the universe is deterministic or not.
