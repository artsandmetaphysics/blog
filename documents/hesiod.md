Hesiod was a famous Greek poets, often listed in the same sentence with Homer.  He is thought to have lived between 800 and 600 BCE.  He wrote at least two epic hexameter poems, *Theogony* and *Works and Days*, each is about 1000 lines in length.

## The Muses and Divine Inspiration

Unlike most of the Greeks, I don't believe that Zeus, Athena, or the other Greek gods existed.  Why did they think their gods existed?  Where did the stories come from if they are not true?

New religious ideas usually evolve from older ideas, thus it is not surprising that Hesiod's stories have similarities to Babylonian, Hittite, and possibly the Indo-European forebearers of the Hindu Vedas.  Hesiod's religious ideas also appear rooted in unexplained natural phenomena.

*Theogony* appears to organize and synthesize older Greek myths, although it seems likely Hesiod brings his own ideas and particulars.  Where did these come from?

Hesiod appears to believe that the Muses---the nine daughters of Zeus and Memory---inspired his poetry:

> And they taught Hesiod the art of singing verse,
> While he pastured his lambs on holy Helikon's slopes.
> And this was the very first thing they told me,
> The Olympian Muses, daughters of Zeus Aegisholder:
>
> "Hillbillies and bellies, poor excuses for shepards:
> We know how to tell many believable lies,
> But also, when we want to, how to speak the plain truth."
>
> So spoke the daughters of great Zeus, mincing their words.
> And they gave me a staff, a branch of good sappy laurel,
> Plucking it off, spectacular.  And they breathed into me
> A voice divine, so I might celebrate past and future.
> And they told me to hymn the generations of the eternal gods,
> But always to sing of themselves, the Muses, first and last ...
>
> Farewell Zeus's daughters, and bestow song that beguiles.
> Make known the eerie brood of the eternal Immortals
> Who were born of Earth and starry Sky,
> And of dusky Night, and whom the salt Sea bore.
> Tell how first the gods and earth came into being
> And the rivers and the sea, endless and surging,
> And the stars shining and the wide sky above;
> How they divided wealth and allotted honors,
> And first possessed deep-ridged Olympus.
>
> Tell me these things, Olympian Muses,
> From the beginning, and tell which of them came first.
> ~ Theogony, 23--35, 103--125

Hesiod does not presume that the Muses told him the truth, but he does presume the possibility that they told him the truth.  In other words, Hesiod presumes that creative stores comes from the Muses and also that the Muses may reveal divine truths in these stories.

We get another glimpse into Hesiod's views of the Muses and truth in *Works and Days*, when he is giving advice to his brother.  Hesiod distinguishes between his own experience and what the Muses have taught him:

> So if you [Hesiod's lazy brother] ever turn your addled wits to trade
> To rid yourself of debt and gnawing hunger,
> I can teach you the rhythms of the churning sea,
> Though sailing's not my line. As far as ships go,
> I've never sailed in one on the open sea
> Except to Euboia once from Aulis, ...
> That's the sum of my experience with pegged & dowelled ships.
> Still, I can teach you the mind of Zeus the Storm King,
> Since the Muses have taught me ineffable song.
> Fifty days after the solstice, toward the end
> Of summer, the seasons of scorching heat,
> Comes the sailing seasons.  You won't wreck
> Your ship then, nor the sea drown your men,
> Unless Poseidon Earthshaker has a mind otherwise,
> Or the Lord of Immortals *wants* to destroy them.
> ~ Works and Days, 717--739

It is difficult for me to understand how someone could create a story while also believing that it is true; it is even more surprising that someone could make up advice on a technical subject and believe it.  But it appears this is what Hesiod is doing!  It would seem that Hesiod believes that the Muses are inserting ideas into his mind, and thus may contain truth.  In other words, he has a spiritual understanding of how creativity works.  One can imagine Hesiod arguing "Surely my ideas could not come from no-where!  Where else, besides the immortal gods, could they come from?"

Hesiod's creativity is not arbitrary and contains its own sort of logic.  Hesiod appears to deduce the existence of a second god, Strife, from the multiple uses of the word "strife":

> It looks like there's not just one kind of Strife—
> That's Eris—after all, but two on the Earth.
> You'd praise one of them once you got to know her,
> But the other's plain blameworthy.  They've just got
> Completely opposite temperaments.
> One of them favors war and fighting. She's a mean cuss
> And nobody likes her, but everybody honors her,
> This ornery Eris.  They have to: it's the gods' will.
>
> The other was born first though.  Ebony Night
> Bore her, and Kronos' son who sits high in thin air
> Set her in Earth's roots, and she's a lot better for humans.
> Even shiftless folks she gets stirred up to work.
>
> When a person's lazing about and sees his neighbor
> Getting rich, because he hurries to plow and plant
> And put his homestead in order, he tends to compete
> With that neighbor in a race to get rich.
>
> Strife like this does people good.
> ~ Works and Days, 21--37

Later in *Works and Days*, towards the end of a list of suggestions for avoiding the god's anger, Hesiod remarks that "Talk" must be a god too, because it never dies:

> That's the way to behave. And try to avoid being
> The object of talk.  A bad reputation is easy to get,
> Difficult to endure, and hard to get rid of.
> Talk never really dies, not when so many folks
> Are busy with her.  Talk too is some kind of a god.
> ~ Works and Days, 840--844

In these two examples, Hesiod deduces the existence of gods using etymology and some sort of metaphysical reasoning (anything that doesn't die must be a lie).

We are not certain whether Hesiod (or Homer) existed, but this irrelevant for the conclusions drawn here---what matters is that the Greek tradition included, and to some degree accepted, the idea of Muses providing divine inspiration via creative human story-telling.  This is one mechanism by-which the details of religions beliefs could evolve and develop, despite not being true.

## Other Thoughts

Hesiod uses genealogy as an organizational and explanatory scheme for the gods.

> Tell how first the gods and earth came into being
> And the rivers and the sea, endless and surging,
> And the starts shining and the wide sky above;
> How they divided wealth and allotted honors,
> And first possessed deep-ridged Olympus ...
> In the beginning there was only Chaos, the Abyss,
> But then Gaia, the Earth, came into being,
> Her broad bosom the ever-firm foundation of all,
> And Tartaros, dim in the underground depths,
> And Eros, loveliest of all the Immortals, who
> Makes their bodies (and men's bodies) go limp,
> Mastering their minds and subduing their wills.
> From the Abyss were born Erebos and dark Night.
> And Night, pregnant after sweet intercourse
> With Erebos, gave birth to Aether and Day.
> Earth's first child was Ouranos, starry Heaven,
> Just her size, a perfect fit on all sides.
> ~ Theogony, 104--127

An apparently similar use of genealogies is found in Genesis, and especially the "Table of Nations" in Genesis 10:

> These are the families of Noah's sons, according to their genealogies, in their nations; and from these the nations spread abroad on the earth after the flood.
> - Genesis 10.32, NRSV

Hesiod depicts most of creation as a sexual act, similar to the *Enuma Elish.*  Other traditions conceptualize creation through speech.  For example, Genesis 1.3 states "Then God said, 'Let there be light' and there was light."  Still others conceptualize creation through material acts.  For example, Genesis 2.7 states "then the Lord God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life."

Sex, speech, and craftsmanship are all creative acts in human life, so it is natural that humans would project them backwards to the creation of the world (and the gods).  Creation

Hesiod presents three types of gods:

1. Personified gods that were worshiped (e.g., Zeus, Aphrodite, Athena)
2. Personified gods that were not worshiped (e.g., Atlas)
3. Gods which represent abstractions (e.g., Dawn, Neglect, Pretences)

It seemed natural to the Greeks to represent abstract concepts as gods, since they are invisible and immortal.

Marduk has many similarities with Zeus.  Both were sky gods who lead a fight over and older generation of gods to become the leading god.

There are also similarities between the *Theogony* and Hittite myths (in particular, the castration story), as well as similarities the Vedas (the three Gods, Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades dividing the earth).

Hesiod was misogynistic, like most other ancient Mesopotamians:

> From her [Pandora] is the race of female women,
> The deadly race and population of women,
> A great infestation among mortal men,
> At home with Wealth but not with Poverty.
> It's the same as with bees in their overhung hives
> Feeding the drones, evil conspirators.
> The bees work every day until the sun goes down,
> Busy all day long making pale honeycombs,
> While the drones stay inside, in the hollow hives,
> Stuffing their stomachs with the work of others.
> ~ Theogony, 594--603

Babylonians thought men were created to feed the gods; Greeks, while still giving scarifies, apparently did not.  Quote about Zeus hiding how to make a living.

Zeus's division of duties and realms is similar to Marduk's in the *Enuma Elish* and also to the Sumerian concept of *me* in Inanna's writings.

Hesiod has a pessMen have gotten weaker over time (anti-progress).

Hesiod spends a long time discussing the goddess Hekate; exemplifies how different cults rise and fade over time.

Homer and Hesiod disagree with each other at some points; Greek religious beliefs varied geographically and temporally.  In Hesiod, Aphrodite is born when Ouranos's castrated members float and foam in the sea.  In Homer, Aphrodite is the daughter of Zeus and Dione.
