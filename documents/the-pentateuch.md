## My Beliefs about the Pentateuch

I believe that the Pentateuch is a beautiful and compelling story of the creation of the world, the patriarchs, and the Israelite's exodus from Egypt and journey through the wilderness.

I believe that the creation story and flood story in Genesis were inspired and adapted from widely-known polytheistic Mesopotamian stories to emphasize the Israelite's all-powerful and moral god and his love of humanity.

I believe that the Pentateuch contains references from Israel and Yahweh's polytheistic past.

I believe that the Pentateuch was combined from multiple older sources so as to tell a cohesive unified story, and that it does tell a cohesive story, but frequently the inconsistencies in the individual sources are evident.  The law codes present throughout most of the Pentateuch are unique from other Mesopotamian law codes in that they were given and enforced by a moral single God and are more egalitarian.  But some of the laws were taken or inspired from older law collections.

I believe that the law collections within the Pentateuch contradict each other sometimes---likely because they were written at different times by different people at different times with different motives.

I believe that there is some historical memory left in the Pentateuch, perhaps even as far back as the patriarchs.  But I believe many of the details were exaggerated or modified over time.

What follows is my outline of the Pentateuch.
