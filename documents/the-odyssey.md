## Background

The ancients believed that the *Odyssey* was composed by the blind poet Homer.  Modern scholars debate when it was composed and by whom, but most agree it was written between 725 BCE and 675 BCE.  It has almost always been held that that the *Odyssey* was written after the *Iliad,* because it refers to material in the *Iliad* frequently, while avoiding any direct duplication.  Furthermore, the character of Nestor, Menelaus, Helen, and Odysseus is consistent with the *Iliad.*

The poem is about 12,000 lines of hexameter verse in the ancient Greek, and is split into 24 books.
