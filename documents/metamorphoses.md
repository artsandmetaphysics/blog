## Background

The *Metamorphoses* is Ovid's poem about change, and in particular changes of form that occur in myths and stories beginning with the creation of the world through the deification of Julius Caesar.

The poem is about 12,000 lines of hexameter verse in Latin, and is split into 15 books.

> The whole world quaked, the slopes of Ida with all her springs
> and all her peaks and the walls of Troy and all Achaea's ships.
> And terror-struck in the underworld, Hades lord of the dead
> cringed and sprang from his throne and screamed shrill,
> fearing the god who rocks the ground above his realm,
> giant Poseidon, would burst the earth wide open now
> and lay bare to mortal men and immortal gods at last
> the houses of the dead---the dank, moldering horrors
> that fill the deathless gods themselves with loathing.
> ~ (20.60-7)
