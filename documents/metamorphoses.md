## Introduction

The *Metamorphoses* is Ovid's epic poem about change.

> My mind leads me to speak now of forms changed
> into new bodies: O gods above, inspire
> this undertaking (which you've changed as well)
> and guide my poem in its epic sweep
> from the world's beginning to the present day.
> ~ (1.1--5)

The poem is about 12,000 lines of hexameter verse in Latin, and is split into 15 books. It was first published in 8 AD.

Ovid focuses on telling the many stories using beautiful and light-hearted language. His audience was familiar with the stories he tells, so it is his approach to telling the stories that makes them as entertaining as they are.

## Book I

In Ovid's creation account, like Hesiod's, the world begins in Chaos:

> Before the seas and lands had been created,
> before the sky that covers everything,
> Nature displayed a single aspect only
> throughout the cosmos; Chaos was its name,
> a shapeless, unwrought mass of inert bulk
> and nothing more, with the discordant seeds
> of disconnected elements all heaped
> together in anarchic disarray.
> ~ (1.6--11)

However, unlike Hesiod's account---which focuses on the sexual creative acts of the gods and their genealogies---Ovid's ignores the gods almost entirely.

And unlike in the Genesis account, where God creates and separates, in Ovid matter existed in the beginning and only had to be separated:

> Although the land and sea and air were present,
> land was unstable, the sea unfit for swimming,
> and air lacked light; shapes shifted constantly,
> and all things were at odds with one another,
> for in a single mass cold strove with warm,
> wet was opposed to dry and soft to hard,
> and weightlessness to matter having weight.
> Some god (or kinder nature) settled this
> dispute by separating earth from heaven,
> and then by separating sea from earth
> and fluid aether from the denser air;
> and after these were separated out
> and liberated from the primal heap,
> he bound the disentangled elements
> each in its place and all in harmony.
> ~ (1.19--33)

He describes how the four winds are separated:

> Nor did that world-creating god permit
> the winds to roam ungoverned through the air;
> for even now, with each of them in charge
> of his own kingdom, and their blasts controlled,
> they scarcely can be kept from shattering
> the world, such is the discord between brothers.
> Eurus went eastward, to the lands of Dawn,
> the kingdoms of Arabia and Persia,
> and to the mountain peaks that lie below
> the morning's rays; and Zephyr took his place
> on the western shores warmed by the setting sun.
> the frozen north and Scythia were seized
> by bristling Boreas; the lands opposite,
> continually drenched by fog and rain,
> are where the south wind, known as Auster, dwells.
> ~ (1.78--92)

After creation, Ovid describes the four ages of man. It is similar to Hesiod's ages of man in _Works and Days_:

Here are the vices of the Iron Age:

> Now men demand that the rich earth provide
> more than the crops and sustenance it owes,
> and piercing to the bowels of the earth,
> the wealth long hidden in Stygian gloom
> is excavated and induces evil;
> for iron, which is harmful, and the more
> pernicious gold (now first produced) create
> grim warfare, which has need of both; now arms
> are grasped in bloodstained hands; men live off plunder,
> and guest has no protection from his host,
> nor father-in-law from his daughter's husband,
> and kindness between brothers is infrequent;
> husband and wife both wish each other dead,
> and wicked stepmothers concoct the bilious
> poisons that turn their youthful victims pale;
> a son goes to a soothsayer to learn
> the date when he will change from heir to owner,
> and piety lies vanquished here below.
> Virgin Astraea, the last immortal left
> on the bloodstained earth, withdraws from it in horror.
> ~ (1.185--204)

Here is part of Hesiod's description of the Iron Age:

> Then fathers won't get along with their kids anymore,
> Nor guests with their hosts, nor partner with partner,
> And brothers won't be friends, the way they used to be.
> Nobody'll honor their parents when they get old
> But they'll curse them and give them a hard time,
> Godless rascals, and never think about paying them back
> For all the trouble it was to raise them.
> ...
> And then up to Olympos from the wide-pathed Earth,
> lovely apportions wrapped in white veils,
> off to join the Immortals, abandoning humans
> There go Shame and Nemesis. And horrible suffering
> Will be left for mortal men, and no defense against evil.
> ~ Works and Days, 212--35

I find it interesting that both accounts imply that new technology, bronze and iron (and perhaps gold coinage), introduce new evils. Both accounts also look back to an earlier, simpler time when humans existed in a purer state.

In both accounts, the gods used to live on Earth but eventually moved up to heaven.

Unlike Hesiod, Ovid does does not include the aberrant Age of Heroes in between the bronze and iron ages. The Age of Heroes, unlike the other four, is not named after a metal and is better than the previous age. I think Hesiod inserted it to meld an older tradition of the metal ages with the Greek's own tradition of the heroes of Thebes and the Trojan ware. In any event, Ovid does not include it.

In response to the wickedness of the Iron Age, Jove calls for a great flood. Unlike in the Babylonian Atrahasis flood myth, where it isn't until after the flood that the gods regret destroying their source of food sacrifices, in Ovid the gods have more foresight:

> Some of the gods give voice to their approval
> of Jove's words and aggravate his grumbling,
> while others play their roles with mute assent.
> Nevertheless, all of them were saddened
> by the proposed destruction of the human race
> and wondered what the future form of earth
> could possibly be like, without men on it:
> why, who would bring the incense to their altars?
> ~ (1.336--43)

Ovid's descriptive power is evident in his portrayal of the flood:

> One takes to the hills, another to his skiff,
> rowing where once he plowed the earth in rows,
> while yet another sails above his grainfields,
> or glimpses, far below, his sunken villa;
> and here in the topmost branches of an elm
> is someone casting out a fishing line;
> an anchor grazes in a meadow's grasses,
> or a curved keel sweeps above a vineyard,
> and the seal's misshapen figure lies at rest
> where the slender goats were lately fond of browsing.
> The Nereids marvel at the sight of groves,
> cities, and dwelling places all submerged,
> while dolphins take possession of the woods
> and shake the lofty branches of the oak
> as they brush by. The wolf swims among sheep,
> the tawny lion and the tiger both
> are carried helplessly upon the waves;
> the boar's great power, like a lightning bolt,
> does not avail nor do the stag's swift limbs.
> After his long search for a landing place,
> the bird with weary wings collapses seaward.
> Now unrestrained, the sea conceals the hills,
> and strange new waves beat at the mountaintops;
> the greater part are drowned beneath the waves,
> while those spared drowning perish of starvation.
> ~ (1.407--31)

Jove stops the flood when he realizes the two remaining survivors devout. After describing how the floods recede, Ovid recounts what Deucalian, the last man alive, says to his wife Pyrrha:

> "O sister, wife, and only woman left,
> you whom the bonds of race and family
> and our marriage bed have joined to me,
> we are now joined by our common perils---
> for we two are the crowd that fills the lands
> seen by the rising and the setting sun---
> we two are all: the sea now has the others.
> And our claim upon our lives is still
> doubtful, for those storm clouds frighten me!
> And how would you be feeling, my poor wretch,
> if fate had snatched you from the flood without me?
> How would you bear this terror all alone?
> Who would console you in your unshared grief?
> For trust me, if the sea had taken you,
> I would have followed then, my wife; the sea
> would not have taken one of us, but two."
> ~ (1.484--99)

While few stories in the _Metamorphoses_ are original, Ovid gives the old characters a new psychological depth; Deucalion's terror at being the only human alive is vivid example of this.

Ovid explains how life was biogenerated from the muck (an accepted theory at the time):

> It is when heat and moisture join as one
> that life is generated; all living forms
> originate from these opposing sources
> ~ (1.595--8)

The python is among the forms that are generated, and Ovid tells the tale of Apollo killing the Python (and establishing the Pythian games to ensure memory of his great dead). Next, Ovid weaves in the first rape story of the _Metamorphoses_:

> Daphne, the daughter of the river god
> Peneus, was the first love of Apollo;
> this happened not by chance, but by the cruel
> outrage of Cupid; Phoebus, in the triumph
> of his great victory against the Python,
> observed him bending back his bow and said,
> "What are *you* doing with such manly arms,
> lascivious boy? That bow befits *our* brawn,
> wherewith we deal out wounds to savage beasts
> and other mortal foes, unerringly:
> just now with our innumerable arrows
> we managed to lay low the mighty Python,
> whose pestilential belly covered acres!
> Content yourself with kindling love affairs
> with your wee torch---and don't claim *our* glory!"
> The son of Venus answered him with this:
> "Your arrow, Phoebus, may strike everything;
> mine will strike you: as animals to gods,
> your glory is so much less than mine!"
> ~ (1.628--46)

Ovid's ability to weave one story into the next makes the Metamorphoses a joy to read. Here, Apollo's pride at defeating the Python causes him to foolishly boast, propelling us into the next story while also presenting a compelling example of overconfidence after accomplishment.

Daphne escapes, but Io is less fortunate. After Jove rapes her he turns her into a cow to hider her from. Juno, knowing as much, convinces Jove to give her the cow and places Argus to watch over her:

> ... Argus, the watchman with a hundred eyes:
> in strict rotation, his eyes slept in pairs,
> while those that were not sleeping stayed on guard.
> No matter where he stood, he looked at Io,
> even when he had turned his back on her.
> ~ (1.869--73)

While a cow, Io's father makes an interesting comment:

> "Nor can I end this suffering by death;
> it is a hurtful thing to be a god,
> for the gates of death are firmly closed against me,
> and our sorrows must go on forever."
> ~ (1.916--9)

Jove can not bear to watch her pain, so he sends Mercury to kill Argus. He tells Argus a tail to make him fall asleep:

> Now Mercury was ready to continue [his story]
> until he saw that Argus had succumbed,
> for all his eyes had been closed down by sleep.
> He silences himself and waves his wand
> above those languid orbs to fix the spell.
> Without delay he grasp the nodding head
> and where it joins the neck, he severs it
> with his curved blade and flings it bleeding down
> the steep rock face, staining it with gore.
> O Argus, you are fallen, and the light
> in all your lamps is utterly put out:
> one hundred eyes, one darkness all the same!
> But Saturn's daughter rescued them and set
> those eyes upon the feathers of her bird,
> filling his tail with constellated gems.
> ~ (1.986--1.1000)

Many of Ovid's stories explain the origin of species (especially of birds), rivers, springs, and constellations.

As an interesting note, the tale that Mercury tells Argus is about the rape of Syrinx; a commentator observed that rape is so common that the story was dull enough to put Argus to sleep (although his wand may have helped too).

## Book II

The tale of Phaëthon's doomed journey is one of my favourite in Ovid. Here is the description of Apollo's throne room:

> Phoebus sat
> In robes of purple high upon a throne
> that glittered brilliantly with emeralds;
> and in attendance on his left and right
> stood Day and Month and Year and Century,
> and all the Hours, evenly divided;
> fresh Spring was there, adorned with floral crown,
> and Summer, naked, bearing ripened grain,
> and Autumn, stained from treading out her grapes,
> and Winter with his grey and frosty locks.
> ~ (2.29--38)

When describing the burning Earth, Ovid's description alludes back to the _Iliad_ (20.60--67):

> The soil cracks everywhere, and now the light
> seeps to the underworld and terrifies
> its ruler and his wife
> ~ (2.345--7)

After Zeus kills Phaëthon with lightening, Apollo mourns:

> His miserable father, sick with grief,
> drew his cloak up around his head in mourning;
> for one whole day then, if the tale is true,
> the sun was quite put out. The conflagration
> (for the world was still ablaze) provided light;
> that was a time some good came out of evil.
> ~ (2.439--45)

The stories in the _Metamorphoses_ frequently refer to earlier incidents. For example:

> When Apollo heard
> the accusation brought against his lover,
> the laurel resting on his brow slipped down;
> in not as much time as it takes to tell,
> his face, his lyre, his high color fell!
> ~ (2.832--6)

Also, when Juno is departing from Tethys and Oceanus in Book II, she rides up on "peacocks fitted out with Argus' eyes"---another reference to book I.

The reference to the laurel tree refers back to the Daphne story in Book I---perhaps hinting that Apollo has already moved on to another lover.

Almost all of the stories end with physical transformations. I like how Ovid describes Ocyrhoë's transformation into a horse:

> It seems my human form is being taken:
> the thought of grass for dinner pleases me,
> and open fields, where I can freely ride
> as I become my relative---a mare!
> Whole horse? But why? My father is but a centaur!"
> Her whining, waning, becomes whinnying,
> as mind and speech both grow confused together,
> and for a moment seemed a sound between
> the noise a horse makes and a human word,
> more like someone who imitates a horse,
> before the sound turned clearly into neighing,
> as she went on all fours through the tall grass.
> Her fingers fused together and a single
> band of light horn surrounded them, a hoof.
> Her neck and mouth were both increased in size
> and her long robe was turned into a tail
> while the hair that used to stray across her neck
> became a mane that fell on her right side;
> made over now in voice and form completely,
> this transformation gave her a new name.
> ~ (2.917--936)

The story of Mercury stealing Apollo's cattle is also told in the Homeric Hymn to Dionysus. Ovid's version is shorter, and there are differences, but in both there is an old man who betrays the location of the cattle. (In Ovid's version the man is less devout and gives away the location confidentially and with little hesitation). It is intriguing to see the development of the story over several centuries.

Minerva visits the goddess Envy to have her enact revenge on irreverent follower. The description of Envy is, even for Ovid, exceptionally vivid:

> She headed straight to Envy's squalid quarters,
> black with corruption, hidden deep within
> a sunless valley where no breezes blow,
> a sad and sluggish place, richly frigid,
> where cheerful fires die upon the hearth
> and fog that never lifts embraces all.
> Arriving here, the warlike maiden stood
> before the house (for heaven's law denied
> her entrance) and with her spear tip rapped
> upon the doors, which instantly flew open,
> revealing Envy at her feast of snakes,
> a fitting meal for her corrupted nature:
> from such a sight, the goddess turned away.
> The object of her visit sluggishly
> arises from the ground where she'd been sitting,
> leaving behind her interrupted dinner
> of half-eaten reptiles. Stiffly she advances,
> and when she sees the beauty of the goddess
> and of her armor, she cannot help but groan,
> and makes a face, and sighs a wretched sigh.
> Then she grows pale, and her body shrivels up.
> Her glance is sidewise and her teeth are black;
> her nipples drip with poisonous green bile,
> and venom from her dinner coats her tongue;
> she only smiles at sight of another's grief,
> nor does she know, disturbed by wakeful cares,
> the benefits of slumber; when she beholds
> another's joy, she falls into decay,
> and rips down only to be ripped apart,
> herself the punishment for being her.
> ~ (2.1049--78)

After Io and Callisto, Jove pursues Europa:

> Majestic power and erotic love
> do not get on together very well,
> nor do they linger long in the same place:
> the father and the ruler of all gods,
> who holds the lightning bolt in his right hand
> and shakes the world when he but nods his head,
> now relinquishes authority and power,
> assuming the appearance of a bull
> to mingle with the other cattle, lowing
> as gorgeously he strolls in the new grass.
> ~ (2.1161--1170)

## Book III

After Europa is stolen, her father "in an action bother paternal and perverse" demands that Cadmus, her brother, find her. Unable to, he decides to flee Tyre and found the new city of Boeotian Thebes. Incidentally, Herodotus believed that Cadmus brought the Phoenician alphabet to the Greeks (_The Histories_ 5.58).

While founding Thebes, a great serpent kills many of Cadmus' men, and so he pursues and kills the serpent. Afterwards, Athena instructs him to sow the serpent's seeds into the ground.

> And then, incredibly, the dull clods stir:
> at first only the little tips of spears
> are visible, emerging from the furrows,
> but these, almost at once are followed by
> the brightly painted waving crests of helmets
> then shoulders, breasts, and arms heavy with weapons,
> and finally a dense-packed mass of shields:
> no different from what you will have seen
> on feats days, in the theater, when the curtain
> lifts from the pit, and the images of men
> painted upon it seem to rise: heads first,
> and then the rest of them, little by little,
> drawn up in one unbroken wave until
> the tiny figures stand erect onstage,
> complete in all respects, from head to feet.
> ~ (3.129--43)

And then these men fight each other until Athena stops them. These so-called sown men (Spartoi) founded Thebes with Cadmus. I think this is the oddest story in the Metamorphoses, and I wonder what significance it had to the ancient Greeks.

> Thebes has been founded now, and even though
> an exile still, you might seem fortunate
> in having Mars and Venus as your in-laws,
> Cadmus; nor is this all, for in addition
> are offspring worthy of your noble wife,
> your sons and daughters, the pledges of your love,
> and grandsons too, already grown to manhood.
> But "fortunate"? A judgment best reserved
> for a man's last day: call no one blest, until
> he dies and the last rites are said for him.
> ~ (3.163--72)

This reasoning is pervasive in Herodotus.

Actaeon stumbles across the virgin goddess Diana, who spitefully turns him into a stag. He is subsequently torn to pieces by his own pack of hunting dogs. (In the _Epic of Gilgamesh_, when Gilgamesh is rejecting Ishtar's love entreaties, he mentions how she turned a prior lover into a wolf who was then chased by his own hunting dogs.)

Actaeon is caught, and his dogs tear him to pieces.

> And it is said
> he did not die until his countless wounds
> had satisfied Diana's awful wrath.
> Folks were divided: there were those who found
> the goddess's actions cruel and unjust,
> while others considered them appropriate
> to the defense of her austere virginity.
> As usual, both parties had their reasons.
> ~ (3.315--22)

Throughout the _Metamorphoses_ Ovid playfully questions the god's morals, as in this quote.

After the Actaeon story, Jove falls for Semele---Cadmus' daughter. Semele becomes pregnant and Juno, to protect her honor, tricks Semele into requesting Jove make love to her the way he does to Juno. Unbeknownst to Semele, this will kill her. Juno takes the form of Semele's nurse.

> A long, inveigling chat of this and that,
> until Jove's name came up. Nurse sighted and said,
> "I *hope* he's Jupiter---although I doubt it:
> the divinity plea? An all-to-common ploy
> among seducers. Suppose he is, though:
> make him provide assurance of his love;
> if he's the real thing, ask him to put on
> all of the trappings of his high office
> and embrace you, showing such almighty splendor
> as when he is received by Lady Juno."
> ~ (3.358--67)

(It is difficult to imagine a woman being seduced by a man claiming to be a god.)

After Juno gets her revenge on Semele, her next victim is Tiresias. Tiresias is blinded for agreeing with Jove that women enjoy sex more than men. Tiresias is then blinded by Juno, but Jove (since "one god can't undo another's doing") gives him the gift of prophecy. Jove seems to enjoy thwarting Juno's punishments---consider also the Callisto story.

Tiresias is a recurring character in the Greek tragedies.

Tiresias' first prediction is that Narcissus, if he knows himself, will not live to old age. The meaning of this was unclear, until Narcissus falls in love with himself. Then Tiresias becomes famous.

> "But *now* I get it! *I* am that other one!
> I've finally seen through my own image!
> I burn with love for---*me*! The spark I kindle
> is the torch I carry: whatever can I do?
> Am I the favor-seeker, or the favor sought?
> "Why seek at all, when all that I desire
> is mine already? Riches in such abundance
> that I've been left completely without means!"
> ~ (3.599-606)

Ovid paints a compelling, yet humorous, picture of obsession with his description of Narcissus' death:

> His last words were directed to the pool:
> "Alas, dear boy, whom I have vainly cherished!"
> Those words returned to him again, and when
> he cried "Farewell!" "*Farewell!*" cried Echo back.
> His weary head sank to the grass; death closed
> those eyes transfixed once by their master's beauty,
> but on the ferry ride across the Styx,
> his gaze into its current did not waver.
> ~ (3.643--50)

Acoetes' story is similar to the seventh Homeric Hymn to Dionysus.

## Epistemology

Ovid does not appear to take the myths he is telling seriously. Throughout the poem, he inserts comic asides. Here I present a few illustrative examples.

Ovid avoids stating which god created the universe:

> Some god (or kinder nature) settled this
> dispute by separating earth from heaven
> ...
> Now when that god (whichever one it was)
> had given Chaos form
> ~ (1.26--41)

He slyly implies that we do not know the source of some stories firsthand:

> So that the skies above might be no more
> secure than earth, the race of Giants plotted
> (we hear) to rule in heaven by themselves
> ~ (1.205--8)

Here he ironically says we have a story on good faith:

> (you needn't take this part of it on faith,
> for it's supported by an old tradition)---
> these stones at once begin to lose their hardness
> and their rigidity; slowly they soften;
> once softened, they begin to take on shapes.
> ~ (1.556--60)

In other places, he speculates about the gods motives:

> He spoke and threw his arms around her neck,
