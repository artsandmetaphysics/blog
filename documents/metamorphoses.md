## Introduction

The *Metamorphoses* is Ovid's epic poem about change.

> My mind leads me to speak now of forms changed
> into new bodies: O gods above, inspire
> this undertaking (which you've changed as well)
> and guide my poem in its epic sweep
> from the world's beginning to the present day.
> ~ (1.1--5)

The poem is about 12,000 lines of hexameter verse in Latin, and is split into 15 books. It was first published in 8 AD.

Ovid focuses on telling the many stories using beautiful and light-hearted language.

## Book I

In Ovid's creation account, like Hesiod's, the world begins in Chaos:

> Before the seas and lands had been created,
> before the sky that covers everything,
> Nature displayed a single aspect only
> throughout the cosmos; Chaos was its name,
> a shapeless, unwrought mass of inert bulk
> and nothing more, with the discordant seeds
> of disconnected elements all heaped
> together in anarchic disarray.
> ~ (1.6--11)

However, unlike Hesiod's account---which focuses on the sexual creative acts of the gods and their genealogies---Ovid's ignores the gods almost entirely.

And unlike in the Genesis account, where God creates and separates, in Ovid matter existed in the beginning and only had to be separated:

> Although the land and sea and air were present,
> land was unstable, the sea unfit for swimming,
> and air lacked light; shapes shifted constantly,
> and all things were at odds with one another,
> for in a single mass cold strove with warm,
> wet was opposed to dry and soft to hard,
> and weightlessness to matter having weight.
> Some god (or kinder nature) settled this
> dispute by separating earth from heaven,
> and then by separating sea from earth
> and fluid aether from the denser air;
> and after these were separated out
> and liberated from the primal heap,
> he bound the disentangled elements
> each in its place and all in harmony.
> ~ (1.19--33)

He describes how the four winds are separated:

> Nor did that world-creating god permit
> the winds to roam ungoverned through the air;
> for even now, with each of them in charge
> of his own kingdom, and their blasts controlled,
> they scarcely can be kept from shattering
> the world, such is the discord between brothers.
> Eurus went eastward, to the lands of Dawn,
> the kingdoms of Arabia and Persia,
> and to the mountain peaks that lie below
> the morning's rays; and Zephyr took his place
> on the western shores warmed by the setting sun.
> the frozen north and Scythia were seized
> by bristling Boreas; the lands opposite,
> continually drenched by fog and rain,
> are where the south wind, known as Auster, dwells.
> ~ (1.78--92)

After creation, Ovid describes the four ages of man. It is similar to Hesiod's ages of man in _Works and Days_:

Here are the vices of the Iron Age:

> Now men demand that the rich earth provide
> more than the crops and sustenance it owes,
> and piercing to the bowels of the earth,
> the wealth long hidden in Stygian gloom
> is excavated and induces evil;
> for iron, which is harmful, and the more
> pernicious gold (now first produced) create
> grim warfare, which has need of both; now arms
> are grasped in bloodstained hands; men live off plunder,
> and guest has no protection from his host,
> nor father-in-law from his daughter's husband,
> and kindness between brothers is infrequent;
> husband and wife both wish each other dead,
> and wicked stepmothers concoct the bilious
> poisons that turn their youthful victims pale;
> a son goes to a soothsayer to learn
> the date when he will change from heir to owner,
> and piety lies vanquished here below.
> Virgin Astraea, the last immortal left
> on the bloodstained earth, withdraws from it in horror.
> ~ (1.185--204)

Here is part of Hesiod's description of the Iron Age:

> Then fathers won't get along with their kids anymore,
> Nor guests with their hosts, nor partner with partner,
> And brothers won't be friends, the way they used to be.
> Nobody'll honor their parents when they get old
> But they'll curse them and give them a hard time,
> Godless rascals, and never think about paying them back
> For all the trouble it was to raise them.
> ...
> And then up to Olympos from the wide-pathed Earth,
> lovely apportions wrapped in white veils,
> off to join the Immortals, abandoning humans
> There go Shame and Nemesis. And horrible suffering
> Will be left for mortal men, and no defense against evil.
> ~ Works and Days, 212--35

I find it interesting that both accounts imply that new technology, bronze and iron (and perhaps gold coinage), introduce new evils. Both accounts also look back to an earlier, simpler time when humans existed in a purer state.

In both accounts, the gods used to live on Earth but eventually moved up to heaven.

Unlike Hesiod, Ovid does does not include the aberrant Age of Heroes in between the bronze and iron ages. The Age of Heroes, unlike the other four, is not named after a metal and is better than the previous age. I think Hesiod inserted it to meld an older tradition of the metal ages with the Greek's own tradition of the heroes of Thebes and the Trojan ware. In any event, Ovid does not include it.

In response to the wickedness of the Iron Age, Jove calls for a great flood. Unlike in the Babylonian Atrahasis flood myth, where it isn't until after the flood that the gods regret destroying their source of food sacrifices, in Ovid the gods have more foresight:

> Some of the gods give voice to their approval
> of Jove's words and aggravate his grumbling,
> while others play their roles with mute assent.
> Nevertheless, all of them were saddened
> by the proposed destruction of the human race
> and wondered what the future form of earth
> could possibly be like, without men on it:
> why, who would bring the incense to their altars?
> ~ (1.336--43)

Ovid's descriptive power is evident in his portrayal of the flood:

> One takes to the hills, another to his skiff,
> rowing where once he plowed the earth in rows,
> while yet another sails above his grainfields,
> or glimpses, far below, his sunken villa;
> and here in the topmost branches of an elm
> is someone casting out a fishing line;
> an anchor grazes in a meadow's grasses,
> or a curved keel sweeps above a vineyard,
> and the seal's misshapen figure lies at rest
> where the slender goats were lately fond of browsing.
> The Nereids marvel at the sight of groves,
> cities, and dwelling places all submerged,
> while dolphins take possession of the woods
> and shake the lofty branches of the oak
> as they brush by. The wolf swims among sheep,
> the tawny lion and the tiger both
> are carried helplessly upon the waves;
> the boar's great power, like a lightning bolt,
> does not avail nor do the stag's swift limbs.
> After his long search for a landing place,
> the bird with weary wings collapses seaward.
> Now unrestrained, the sea conceals the hills,
> and strange new waves beat at the mountaintops;
> the greater part are drowned beneath the waves,
> while those spared drowning perish of starvation.
> ~ (1.407--31)

Jove stops the flood when he realizes the two remaining survivors devout. After describing how the floods recede, Ovid recounts what Deucalian, the last man alive, says to his wife Pyrrha:

> "O sister, wife, and only woman left,
> you whom the bonds of race and family
> and our marriage bed have joined to me,
> we are now joined by our common perils---
> for we two are the crowd that fills the lands
> seen by the rising and the setting sun---
> we two are all: the sea now has the others.
> And our claim upon our lives is still
> doubtful, for those storm clouds frighten me!
> And how would you be feeling, my poor wretch,
> if fate had snatched you from the flood without me?
> How would you bear this terror all alone?
> Who would console you in your unshared grief?
> For trust me, if the sea had taken you,
> I would have followed then, my wife; the sea
> would not have taken one of us, but two."
> ~ (1.484--99)

While few stories in the _Metamorphoses_ are original, Ovid gives the old characters a new psychological depth; Deucalion's terror at being the only human alive is vivid example of this.

Ovid explains how life was biogenerated from the muck (an accepted theory at the time):

> It is when heat and moisture join as one
> that life is generated; all living forms
> originate from these opposing sources
> ~ (1.595--8)

The python is among the forms that are generated, and Ovid tells the tale of Apollo killing the Python (and establishing the Pythian games to ensure memory of his great dead). Next, Ovid weaves in the first rape story of the _Metamorphoses_:

> Daphne, the daughter of the river god
> Peneus, was the first love of Apollo;
> this happened not by chance, but by the cruel
> outrage of Cupid; Phoebus, in the triumph
> of his great victory against the Python,
> observed him bending back his bow and said,
> "What are *you* doing with such manly arms,
> lascivious boy? That bow befits *our* brawn,
> wherewith we deal out wounds to savage beasts
> and other mortal foes, unerringly:
> just now with our innumerable arrows
> we managed to lay low the mighty Python,
> whose pestilential belly covered acres!
> Content yourself with kindling love affairs
> with your wee torch---and don't claim *our* glory!"
> The son of Venus answered him with this:
> "Your arrow, Phoebus, may strike everything;
> mine will strike you: as animals to gods,
> your glory is so much less than mine!"
> ~ (1.628--46)

Ovid's ability to weave one story into the next makes the Metamorphoses a joy to read. Here, Apollo's pride at defeating the Python causes him to foolishly boast, propelling us into the next story while also presenting a compelling example of overconfidence after accomplishment.

Daphne escapes, but Io is less fortunate. After Jove rapes her he turns her into a cow to hider her from. Juno, knowing as much, convinces Jove to give her the cow and places Argus to watch over her:

> ... Argus, the watchman with a hundred eyes:
> in strict rotation, his eyes slept in pairs,
> while those that were not sleeping stayed on guard.
> No matter where he stood, he looked at Io,
> even when he had turned his back on her.
> ~ (1.869--73)

While a cow, Io's father makes an interesting comment:

> "Nor can I end this suffering by death;
> it is a hurtful thing to be a god,
> for the gates of death are firmly closed against me,
> and our sorrows must go on forever."

Jove can not bear to watch her pain, so he sends Mercury to kill Argus. He tells Argus a tail to make him fall asleep:

> Now Mercury was ready to continue [his story]
> until he saw that Argus had succumbed,
> for all his eyes had been closed down by sleep.
> He silences himself and waves his wand
> above those languid orbs to fix the spell.
> Without delay he grasp the nodding head
> and where it joins the neck, he severs it
> with his curved blade and flings it bleeding down
> the steep rock face, staining it with gore.
> O Argus, you are fallen, and the light
> in all your lamps is utterly put out:
> one hundred eyes, one darkness all the same!
> But Saturn's daughter rescued them and set
> those eyes upon the feathers of her bird,
> filling his tail with constellated gems.
> ~ (1.986--1.1000)

Many of Ovid's stories explain the origin of species (especially of birds), rivers, springs, and constellations.

## Epistemology

Ovid does not appear to take the myths he is telling seriously. Throughout the poem, he inserts comic asides. Here I present a few illustrative examples.

Ovid avoids stating which god created the universe:

> Some god (or kinder nature) settled this
> dispute by separating earth from heaven
> ...
> Now when that god (whichever one it was)
> had given Chaos form
> ~ (1.26--41)

He slyly implies that we do not know the source of some stories firsthand:

> So that the skies above might be no more
> secure than earth, the race of Giants plotted
> (we hear) to rule in heaven by themselves
> ~ (1.205--8)

Here he ironically says we have a story on good faith:

> (you needn't take this part of it on faith,
> for it's supported by and old tradition)---
> these stones at once begin to lose their hardness
> and their rigidity; slowly they soften;
> once softened, they begin to take on shapes.
> ~ (1.556--60)

In other places, he speculates about the gods motives:

> He spoke and threw his arms around her neck,
> imploring her upon his very life,
> and on that of his stepfather, Merops,
> and by the wedding torches of his sisters,
> to give him proof of who his father was.
> Clymene, moved by Phaêthon's petition
> (or by the insult to her own good name),
> ~ (1.1055--64)

## Similes

Apollo's sudden love for Daphne:

> Now just as in a field the harvest stubble
> is all burned off, or as hedges are set ablaze
> when, if by chance, some careless traveler
> should brush one with his torch or toss away
> the still-smoldering brand at break of day---
> just so the smitten god went up in flames
> until his heart was utterly afire,
> and hope sustained his unrequited passion.
> ~ (1.678--85)

## Other Interesting Quotes

Ovid's description of the heavens is humorous, as the gods themselves have household gods:

> When the nighttime sky is clear, there can be seen
> a highway visible in heaven, named
> the Milky Way, distinguished for its whiteness.
> Gods take this path to the royal apartments
> of Jove the Thunderer; on either side
> are palaces with folding doors flung wide,
> and filled with guests of their distinguished owners;
> plebeian gods reside in other sections,
> but here in this exclusive neighborhood,
> the most renowned of heaven's occupants
> have *their* own household deities enshrined;
> and if I were permitted to speak freely,
> I would not hesitate to call this enclave
> the Palatine of heaven's ruling class.
> ~ (1.229--42)

Towards the end of Book I, Clymenes tells her son that:

> "It will not be a great task to discover
> the place where your father [Apollo] keeps his household gods."
> ~ (1.1074--5)
