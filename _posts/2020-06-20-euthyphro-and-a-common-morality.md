  _Euthyphro_ and a Universal Religious Morality
description: >
  I connect _Euthyphro_’s first two definitions of piety to the belief in a common moral standard among religions.
---

Euthyphro’s first defines _piety_ as “something dear to the gods.”

Socrates’ proceeds to pick at it. He observes that the gods quarrel; Zeus says to help Hercules, while Hera says to hinder him. This definition produces conflicting demands, and must be wrong.

In response, Euthyphro revises his definition: _piety_ is “what all the gods love.”

Since Socrates’ rebuke depends on their being multiple gods, a monotheist may not accept it because the original definition is sufficient. With polytheists going extinct, is Socrates’ rebuttal, and Euthyphro’s response, still relevant?

People who hope that everyone can get along—that all religion’s share a common morality—are like polytheists since, religions, like gods, make conflicting demands.

In the same way Euthyphro’s second definition reduces piety what is loved by _all_ the gods, so too they must reduce morality to what is shared by all religions.

This definition is appealing, but Euthyphro and his humanist ancestors face two difficulties: What if there is no common ground? And who are you to decide what is essential? How can you discard the pilgrimage to the Mecca, or neuter Christianity of baptism and communion? Perhaps it is not possible to be a pious Zeus-worshiper and Kronos-worshiper.

Socrates explains what the gods disagree about:

<blockquote class="prose">
<p>SOCRATES: What are the subjects that cause hatred and anger? Let us look at it this way. If you and I were to differ about numbers as to which is the greater, would this difference make us enemies and angry with each other, or would we proceed to count and soon resolve our difference about them?</p>
<p>EUTHYPHRO: We would certainly do so.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Again, if we differed about the larger and the smaller, we would turn to measurement and soon cease to differ.</p>
<p>EUTHYPHRO: That is so …</p>
<p>SOCRATES: What subject of difference would make us angry and hostile to each other if we were unable to come to a decision? … These subjects are the just and the unjust, the beautiful and the ugly, the good and the bad. Are these not the subjects of difference about which, when we are unable to come to a satisfactory decision, you and I and other men become hostile to each other whenever we do? <cite>(7b–d)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

It seems that religions may also disagree about subjective measures, like justice and beauty, but they also disagree on the truth. Not all facts can be verified with measurement. Was Muhammad a prophet? Did Jesus rise from the dead?

It is impressive how relevant _Euthyphro_ remains nearly 2,500 years after Plato wrote it.
