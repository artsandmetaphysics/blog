  _Euthyphro_ a Common Moral Standard Between Religions
description: >
  I connect _Euthyphro_’s first two definitions to the belief in a common moral standard among religions.

Euthyphro’s first defines _piety_ as “something dear to the gods.”

Socrates’ proceeds to pick at it. He observes that the gods quarrel; Zeus says to help Hercules, while Hera says to hinder him. Both can’t be true, so this definition is wrong!

Euthyphro next defines _piety_ as “what all the gods love.”

Socrates’ rebuke depends on their being multiple gods, so a monotheist may rest content with this first definition.

Is this discussion still relevant?  Although polytheists are going extinct, there are people who hope all religion’s can be combined to a central core. The religions, like the gods, have conflicting requirements.

Euthyphro and his humanist ancestors have two difficulties: First, what if there is no common ground? Second, who are you to decide what is essential? How can you discard the pilgrimage to the Mecca, or neuter Christianity of baptism and communion? Perhaps it is not possible to be a pious Zeus-worshiper and Kronos-worshiper.

When Socrates is considering why the god’s quarrel, he says:

<blockquote class="prose">
<p>SOCRATES: What subject of difference would make us angry and hostile to each other if we were unable to come to a decision? … These subjects are the just and the unjust, the beautiful and the ugly, the good and the bad. <cite>(7d)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

This seems to apply to religions too, although religions often quarell about facts to. Was he a prophet? Is this book inspired?

It is impressive how relevant _Euthyphro_ remains nearly 2,500 years after Plato wrote it.
