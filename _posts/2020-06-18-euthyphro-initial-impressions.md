  Initial Impression of _Euthyphro_

  What is piety? Is it possible to define? Here are my first thoughts on the first of Plato’s dialogues I have read.
---

I just finished reading _Euthyphro_ and would like to collect my first impressions. It is the first of Plato’s dialogues that I have read, besides bits of the _Republic_ in college.  It is amazing.

Socrates runs into Euthyphro, who apparently is a priest or prophet and is suing his father for murdering someone who in turn murdered their slave. Socrates asks Euthyphro what piety is, since surely he knows if he is so confident as to sue his own father. The remainder of the dialogue involves them discussing the nature of piety. After attempting several definitions, all of which Socrates dismantles, Euthyphro leaves since he is too busy to continue.

Two passages stuck out. I believe the first is famous:

<blockquote class="prose">
<p>SOCRATES: Consider this: Is the pious loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the god? <cite>(10a)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

It is an important question, for if piety (or righteousness generally) exists apart from the gods, then one can imagine an absolute moral standard apart from the gods.

The second passage implies that Socrates believes there is a mathematically simple definition of complex word such as “piety:”

<blockquote class="prose">
<p>SOCRATES: If the pious is part of the just, we must, it seems, find out what part of the just it is. Now if you asked me something of what we mentioned just now, such as what part of number is the even, and what number that is, I would say it is the number that is divisible into two equal, not unequal, parts. Or do you not think so?</p>
<p>EUTHYPHRO: I do.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Try in this way to tell me what part of the just the pious is … <cite>(12d)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

I think Socrates is mistaken and that no such clear definition is possible, because of the nature of language and how it is produced and used.

I think Euthyphro agrees with me, since after several refuted attempts at defining piety, he says:

<blockquote class="prose">
<p>EUTHYPHRO: I told you a short while ago, Socrates, that it is a considerable task to acquire any precise knowledge of these things, but, to put it simply, I say that if a man knows how to say and do what is pleasing to the gods at prayer and sacrifice, those are pious actions such as preserve both private houses and public affairs of state. The opposite of these pleasing actions are impious and overturn and destroy everything. <cite>(14b)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

Plato probably was aware of the counter argument that no such definitions are possible, yet, given my knowledge of “Platonic forms” it seems he believed such ideal definitions are possible. I hope to learn why he thinks words like “piety” are possible to define, or, if he doesn’t, then why he thinks they “exist.”

Although I don’t believe he means it, Socrates’ earnest and self-degrading dialogue feels insulting:

<blockquote class="prose">
<p>SOCRATES: Yet you are younger than I by as much as you are wiser. As I say, you are making difficulties because of your wealth of wisdom. Pull yourself together, my dear sir, what I am saying is not difficult to grasp. <cite>(12a)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

During the discussion, Socrates uses interesting methods of analysis. Once stuck iterating on definitions, he changes direction and compares piety and justice; if you can not solve a problem, compare it to other related problems. Socrates also uses examples and analogies often. For example, to understand what is meant by “caring for the gods” he considers horse breeders, hunters caring for their dogs, and “cattle-raisers.”

It is interesting that Euthyphro believes he is a prophet and that he has never foretold something that did not happen. It is also surprising that Euthyphro seems to know off hand, as if it were public knowledge, that Socrates has “divine signs” that keep coming to him. What is this about? It is also strange that they seem distinct from the prophecy that Euthyphro believes he can perform.

I look forward to reading more of Plato’s works.
