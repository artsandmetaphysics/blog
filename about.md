## The Author


I live in New York City with my wife and daughter. I run a software development company.

I enjoy reading, thinking, and writing; I'm especially interested in how to live the good life.

Due to the sensitive nature of some of the topics discussed on this site, I do not provide my name.

## This Site

This site provides me a place to store my works where I can read them from my phone and can share them with others.

I also hope that the occasional visitor to this site will contact me and provide new thoughts about the topics I am writing about.
