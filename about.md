## The Author

I live in New York City with my wife and daughter, and I founded and run a medical software development company.

I enjoy reading, thinking, and writing. I'm especially interested in how to live the good life, how to know what the good life is.

Due to the sensitive nature of the topic, I write anonymously.

## This Site

The essays represent my current thoughts on a topic, and are revised alongside my view.

The notes and commentary are likely less interesting to a general audience; they contain many quotations and my summaries on various works---mostly classics. I worry that the number and length of the quotations I included extends beyond what is allowable by fair use; as best I can tell, they do not, but I sincerely hope not to cause harm to any of the translators, authors, or publishers I quote.

The meditations are short pieces, usually written in a single sitting, that reflect my thoughts and questions on a given day. I only rarely edit these once written, and I provide the date of the works.

I hope that the occasional visitor to this site will contact me and provide new thoughts about the topics I am writing about.

I have set up a basic email list to try and stay in touch with visitors who are interested in the content.
