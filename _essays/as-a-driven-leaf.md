*As a Driven Leaf* is thought-provoking and entertaining.  According to my history book, the setting was accurate---even a couple of the philosophers Elisha met lived at the same time.  The Jewish people have been persecuted terribly for so long.  The Romans were brutal during the Bar Kokhba revolt.

The personal story of Elisha was sad and captivating, even more so because (according to the book's introduction) it paralleled Milton Steinberg's experiences in New York.

I transcribed the conversation between Elisha and his friend Akiba, that occured just before Elisha fleed to Antioch.  I think it is the most interesting conversation in the book.

> "Elisha, what strange things have you been thinking?  I knew that you were disturbed but I never dreamed it had gone so far.  Am I correct in believing..."
>
> "Yes," came the toneless reply, "everything is gone, not steadily and all the time, but quite generally---everything except for faith in God."
>
> "Impossible!"
>
> "So I sometimes think.  But it is so."
>
> "Then you must make an effort to recapture what you have lost.  I will help you gladly."
>
> Elisha shook his head obdurately.
>
> "Then what will you do?" Concern rang clear in Akiba's voice.
>
> "I am going to start at the beginning, by laying aside all prejudices, all preconceived notions, all my beliefs and affirmations."
>
> "I am afraid," Akiba faltered, "that I do not understand.  What will be gained if you substitute blanket denial for a wavering faith?"
>
> Elisha rose and began to walk up and down the length of the columned porch, as Greek philosophers and rhetoricians had done when, a century before, they had met with royalty in this place.
>
> "Let me put it this way.  We have both studied Euclid's *Elements of Geometry*.  You must have been impressed by the lucidity of the reasoning and the sureness of its results.  For some time, I have been conscious of the contrast between the method of the Greeks and ours.  Their success, I am convinced, followed from the fact that they started from the foundations.  We, on the contrary, have always tried to bolster our pre-established case."
>
> He ceased pacing and stood over Akiba.
>
> "Akiba, we have been friends for many years.  You have been dearer to me than a blood brother.  I would not hurt you or disturb your peace.  But I know you.  You are honest to the very core.  Never have I seen you tolerate a lie or an evasion.  Therefore, you must undertake this effort with me.  Let us start at the beginning together."
>
> The issue had been stated.  In all the subsequent wrestling of their minds over it, they did not refer even once to the ordeal of that morning [Palestinian Jews who had been involved with the second Jewish-Roman war were tortured to death].  But the memory of it persisted, coloring, flavoring their discussion, investing it with an urgency and import that transcended the decisions of individuals.
>
> "But I still do not understand," Akiba had protested, "how you can expect me to discard beliefs even tentatively if I am really possessed by them.  Your suggestion is like the procedure of those Greek philosophers who say, 'I do not trust my reason, but I will use it to prove that I have no right to use it.' A man may insist that he lays a doctrine aside, but if it is integral to him, he will carry it with him wherever he goes and will inevitably find it again since it has never left him."
>
> "But certainly one can put an attitude away."
>
> "You can only remove from yourself that which is not part of you.  To be altogether honest, Elisha, I think that you might engage in such a project.  I could not."
>
> "You mean," Elish struck, "that you are afraid to subject to honest examination any proposition which you like to accept?"
>
> "Let us not abuse each other," Akiba demurred.  "We owe each other no explanations.  Certainly I have not right to ask for any.  You who have few, if any, beliefs left are sufficiently detached from our traditional faith to be able to suspend it.  I am not."
>
> "Suppose then you tell me," Elisha asked in agitation, "how, knowing as much as I, you can maintain a naÃ¯ve faith?"
>
> "The purpose of life," said Akiba softly, "is to live well.  Whatever contributes toward that end is right and true.  My first and last criterion concerning my proposition is: Does it help men live better?  You may remember a lecture in which I asserted 'All is foreseen by God, yet man possesses freedom of will.' "
>
> "But Akiba..."
>
> "Hear me out, Elisha, please.  I am aware of that, judged by the logic of Aristotle, my thesis is a contradiction in terms.  But there is a higher logic, a rationality that springs from the necessities of human nature.  Does not man face life with greater assurance if he believes that a benevolent providence foresees the future?  And yet he must at the same time be confident that his will is free, otherwise moral effort is meaningless altogether.  Doctrines in themselves are not important to b me, but their consequences are.  For example, I urge upon men that they regard themselves as embodiments of the divine essence.  If I convince them, their days endowed with a sense of abiding significance and unturning glory.  Then not all the misfortunes and degradations to which they may be subjected can take from them their feeling of oneness with angels and starts.  And as for our people, persecuted and dispersed, they live under the shadow of death, cherishing a dream that is recurrently shattered by the caprice of tyrants and then dreamed again half in despair.  What can enable such a people to persist except a conviction of a special relationship to God?"
>
> "And the objective truth of that conviction?" Elisha broke in impatiently.
>
> "A large and terrible question, I grant.  Nevertheless, the first and ultimate consideration, I insist, must be effects.  If any doctrine enlarges life, then it possesses truth in realms beyond Aristotle's logic."
>
> "Surely now," Elisha retorted, unable to contain himself longer, "all wisdom will die with you.  Why, every fool who cherishes some superstition, every rogue who seeks to persuade someone else of a lie, can justify himself by insisting that so he will live the better.  The murderer can argue that his days will be enriched if the person he hates is put away.  The thief can contend that his existence takes an added significance as he obtains possession of another's property.  Every adulterer pleads that his life is not worth the living unless he wins the body of his paramour."
>
> "You are deliberately making an absurdity of what I said," Akiba broke in resentfully.
>
> "Indeed not.  Yours is a good principle to be sure.  Alas, it proves too much.  It justifies everything and its opposite.  What is more, you know as well as I that if there be no God, it is a lie to speak about Him no matter how well such a falsehood functions.  And your readiness to believe, your willingness to accept doctrines on blind faith and then defend them on grounds of expediency..."
>
> "By what right," Akiba protested, "do you presume to call my attitude blind?  Belief need not be unseeing.  Is it a darkening of council to admit that truth is not a matter of the mind alone, but of the heart and experience also?  Since it cannot be obtained by reason unaided, faith is indispensable both as a base on which thought may stand, and as a check-rein when logic goes astray.
>
> "He who wishes to trace a circle must first select out of all space one point about which to draw it.  The choice of the utility of the circle in practice will determine ultimately the axis about which we move---an axis that must be posited as an act of will.  The fate of man determines whether he has located it properly.  That is all I am saying---that belief is the beginning, that it may be tested by experience, but that it must exist, or nothing can be."
>
> "Arrant nonsense," Elisha interjected contemptuously.
>
> "It was to be expected," Akiba went on heatedly, "that you would say so.  To speak of faith to the man without faith is like communicating the experience of color to one who is blind."
>
> His last words stung Elisha.  Tears started in his eyes.  Abruptly he turned his back on Akiba and looked through dimness into the distance.  He could not believe simply because it was easier or more expedient.  He could not have faith unless first his mind was satisfied.  He had set himself to a task, the discovery of truth by reason, pure and unafraid [pp. 239 - 244].

When Akiba claims that the "fate of man determines whether he has located it [the center of a circle, representing the axioms of your philosophy]" he is arguing that ethical outcomes can help us know what is true.  I conceive of philosophy as having three primary questions:

- Metaphysics --- What is the nature of reality?
- Epistemology --- How does one know?
- Ethics --- What should I do?

Most philosophies answer these primary questions recursively.  Metaphysics and epistemology in particular are difficult to separate.  For example, the typical scientist's philosophy has a metaphysical system that informs how our bodies sense and perceive the world, but our senses are the basis for our knowledge (epistemology).

Most philosophy's ethics follow from their metaphysics and epistemology.  Akiba is arguing that ethics informs epistemology.  This is an unusual position.

Here is an extreme example of ethics affecting metaphysics: how one acts changes the laws of physics.  It could be true!  For example, I could program Altera so that when a Nook acts a certain way, the laws of Alteran physics change.  This radical idea is so far from the scientific that it seems implausible.  "One can only remove from yourself that which is not part of you."  For ethics to affect metaphysics, we must assume that humans (or concious beings generally) are special.  Perhaps we have souls or the creator cares about our matter more than other lumps of matter.  Both of these metaphysical claims are possible.  If we are not special in *some* sense, however, then ethics must be isolated from metaphysics and epistemology.

I think the thesis of *As a Drive Leaf* is that *ethics should inform our epistemology and our metaphysics*.

Besides Akiba's arguments in this first conversation, you can see Milton Steinberg arguing for this thesis throughout the book.  He implies that the Jewish religious tradition's "truth" or "validity" partially originates from the fact that the Jewish people have survided persecution for so many years.

Elisha's path of philosophical discovery is an argument for this thesis.  After Elisha flees to Antioch, he spends all of his energy working on a philosophical system.  Steinberg does not tell us much about Elisha's system besides the title of the introduction---*Prerequisites for All Metaphysical Systems Derived from the Methods Suggested by Aristotle in his* Organon*, and more particularly from those implied in Euclid's* Elements of Geometry.

After years of study and discussion with other Greek philosophers, Elisha gives up in defeat.  Here is an outline of his philosophical journey:

1. Blind belief in Judaism; is taught under Rabbi Joseph, a great pious man, for many years before becoming a Rabbi.
2. Losses faith; his favorite student's two children die, he begins studying Greek philosophy and in particular Euclid, then sees a servant boy fall from a tree and die.  Flees to Antioch.
3. Studies Greek philosophy, attempting to build a sound metaphysical foundation on which to build an ethical system.
4. Losses faith in pure reason to accomplish his original goals.

The first conversation quoted above takes place right as he is losing his faith.  There are three more interesting conversations that occur after this.  The first is between Elisha and Demonax---a philosopher who has decided to focus more on ethics than metaphysics.  The second is between Elisha and a philosopher who, like Elisha, believes we can develop a firm metaphysical foundation---this conversation is when Elisha looses faith in his metaphysical foundation.  The final conversation is between Elisha and Meir, his favorite student, many years later.

Here is the conversation between Demonax and Elisha:

> "Let me explain," Demonax continued.  "To you philosophy is a science.  To me it is an art.  To you it is a method of discovering truth.  To me it is a guide to noble living.  We are too far removed in essential attitudes to be capable of co-operation."
>
> "I am afraid I do not understand."
>
> "No, I suppose my point is quite obscure.  And yet it marks a real difference.  The great thinkers, from Heraclitus on, have approached philosophy as you do.  Plato, Aristotle, Democritus, even Zeno and Epicurus, have all been builders of systems.  But for all their prestige, they are not my teachers.  If I were to list my favorite sages I would say I revere Socrates, admire Diogenes and love Aristippus.  For I am the expositor not of a theory but of a skill.  As a flute teacher imparts his art, first by personal example and then by simple, practical principles, without too much concern over the nature of sound, so I attempt to influence people to live beautifully by striving to live so myself, and by communicating those rules of conduct that have stood the test of time."
>
> "But," Elisha demurred, "no art can be entirely divorced from theory."
>
> "Perfectly true," Demonax replied.  "That is why I have some interest in metaphysics, but only in the barest and most essential minimum of it.  It is guidance in their behavior which men need, a vision of immediate, attainable objective to which they can dedicate themselves, not high-flown schemes of reality.  Of the latter a man has enough if he attains to a reasonable belief in God and a fairly consistent picture of the universe and man's role in it."
>
> "But even that minimum," Elisha protested, "must be thought through.  You would not say that men should accept belief in God unless first they have reasoned their way to it clearly, consistently and indisputably.  Or that they ought to adopt a code of morality unless they have convinced themselves of it s validity."
>
> The sadness in Demonax's eyes became more perceptible.
>
> "It is almost," he sighed, "as though I am hearing myself speak as I was many, many ears ago.  I, too, once felt as you did.  But I have grown older and, if you will pardon my saying so, wiser.  I have studied all the major metaphysical systems with care and found not s a single issue which they have demonstrated absolutely.  To make matters worse, there is not one conclusion on which they agree.  The schools remind me of nothing so much as the fable in Hebrew literature about a tower which would have been build to heaven were it not that all the artisans were afflicted by a confusion of tongues."
>
> "But after all," Elisha objected, " there is just as little agreement in the realm of practices principle as in that of theory.  Your own argument can be turned against you.  One might well say: There is no unity of opinion as to ethics, no one has ever attained moral perfection, therefore the quest after the better life ought to be abandoned.  If ever there was an instance of self-contraction..."
>
> He stopped, realizing that he was overstepping the bounds of good taste.
>
> "You will pardon me, I hope, for my bluntness.  I did not mean to offend you."
>
> The sage was unperturbed except that the look of compassion on his face had deepened.
>
> "You are right," he said.  "I am not altogether logical.  Here I tell you that the quest after metaphysical certainty is not worth while because after several centuries of effort it has not attained its objectives.  And at the very same moment I say that one ought to devote his efforts to teaching people how to behave although there is no agreement as to the better life and, so far as we are aware, no one has ever lived it in its completeness.  But the contradiction is not mine.  It is nature's.  The human scene is not some philosopher's garden, but a confusing, dark struggle.  Through its noise and obscurity men grope, all seeking for serenity, few finding it.  And some of us, though we have not completely demonstrated our principles, believe that we know how they may make themselves both better and happier.  Can we withdraw into books and their abstrusities when men need insight into their souls, balms for their wounds, and healing of their sorrows?  Ah, yes, if you and I were the gods, as Epicurus describes them, we might devote our lives to debating the question whether or not Platonic ideas exist eternally in realms beyond space and time.  But we are flesh and blood.  We dare not, for intellectual luxury, forget our aches or those of our brothers."
>
> "But if so," Elisha cried out, "it will go on forever.  If they possess no certainty and are never fully convinced of anything men will always take refugee in aphorisms and maxims.  I am not insensitive to human suffering, but the slow cure is sometimes the surer.  Suppose people are lost in some dark threatening forest without food or shelter.  Ought not someone climb a tree to discern the forest as a whole and the paths by which he and his fellows can escape from it?  Or, to change the metaphor, if, as in Plato's dialogue, we are to sit forever looking at shadows, we shall never see the sun.  Now consider Euclid's *Elements of Geometry*.  A mathematician evolves a truth concerning space.  There-after every builder, whether of a ship, a temple, or a bridge, can proceed from it with confidence. So, only if there be first an indisputable interpretation of reality and a moral system drawn from it, will men be able to live, as engineers and architects work, with assurance."
>
> "And the failure of the schools in the past," Demonax challenged softly, "their inability to agree, you are prepared to make the effort despite that?"
>
> "I am." Elisha replied, "I hope to find conviction in some established system.  Otherwise I shall create one for myself, borrowing from the older philosophies whatever is valid, but in any case proceeding like Euclid from unchallengeable axioms to unshakable conclusions, whatever they may be, however hard to accept.  It is presumptuous, I know, for me to think that I will succeed where others have failed.  But there were mathematicians before the author of the *Elements*.  Someone has to try.  Why not I?  Someone will succeed.  Perhaps I."
>
> "Presumptuous?" Demonax breathed.  "Aye, as Prometheus was presumptuous.  If only I were not so old, so weighted by futility, so oppressed by the urge to give immediate assistance of those in need, and also of so little faith, I would work with you.  As it is, I commit you to Athene, the goddess of inner light." [pp. 366 - 369]


> "... Let us admit," he declaimed, his speech flowing on, his face a mask of assumed interest, "that the senses are not trustworthy since objects appear of different sizes and shapes to different people, and are perceived variously by the same person as he changes his position; since what is brown to one man is red to another, and without hue to the color-blind; since the identical surface will feel coarse or smooth, warm or cold, depending on the sensitivity of the hand that comes into contact with it.  Let us concede even that the whole of our experience is but a phantasm.  A somewhat embarrassing assumption, to be sure, suggesting that neither you nor I may be really here, making you my pleasant dream and me, with my interminable talk, as nightmare to you, from which you cannot awaken too quickly."
>
> Charicles took a deep breath and waited for the restrained laughter to subside.  As was his practice, he began again before quiet was entirely restored.  His sonorous voice rang out across the waning mirth as though he were too impatient to wait.
>
> "But does that mean that there is no certainty, that accurate knowledge is and must forever remain unattainable?
>
> "Not so.  The skeptic lies, and here and now I throw his falsehood into his leering face.  The truth can be won, provided one knows where to seek it and how to move toward it.  For there is another method, independent of the sense---the technique of the founders of great philosophical systems of all times, the approach outlined in the \emph{Organon} of Aristotle---the deductive process whereby one moves from lucid simple first premises through syllogisms to conclusions, more complicated but equally unequivocal and undeniable.
>
> "See," he urged, "how generous nature has been with us, equipping our minds from birth with sure truths for which we need not labor and which no sane person ever challenges.  Will the boldest skeptic deny that two and two equal four, no more, no less; that the whole is the sum of its parts; that equals, added to equals, yield equals; that every effect must have a cause; that A cannot be B and its opposite at the same time, that ...?  But why belabor so obvious a point  Each of you can list dozens, hundreds, perhaps thousands of principles of like character.
>
> "Nature, I have said, has been kindly with us.  A grotesque understatement.  More than generous, she has been munificent.  For, in addition to innate verities of the type I have just described, she has furnished us with the instruments of logic whereby we may through our own efforts derive from her original gift limitless treasures of larger richeness.
>
> "Can there be any conclusion but one to the sequence:
>
> > "All men are mortal;
> >
> > "Socrates is a man;
> >
> > "Therefore Socrates is mortal?
>
> "Yet, deep within you, there is, I know , an unspoken question.  If their truth may be attained, you ask how comes it that after generations it does not lie full-blown in our hands.  Ah, my friends, let us knot, in our disappointment, exaggerate.  There are realms where certainty is ours already--areas of mathematics, physics, and even of metaphysics where old insistent riddles have been solved for all time.  And as for the remaining areas of human interest, there too, we are not without hope, provided always that we posses a triad of virtues---caution, probity and patience---caution in our selection of first premises, probity in the deductions from the them, and, greatest of the three, patience.  It is for lack of this last that the most colossal blunders have been made in the past.  Too often have men, despising in their wishful impetuosity slow, safe plodding, overleaped all that intervened in a direct flight to their destination---only to find that they had arrived not at truth but illusion.
>
> "It is, men of Antioch, of the part of wisdom to learn, but not to be discouraged, by experience.  Let us then restrain our eager hearts, discipline our restless minds and we shall together penetrate ever further the frontiers of the doubtful and the unintelligible.
>
> "Patience, my friends, an someday we, and if not we, our children or our children's children will yet be able to say in response to the choices, intellectual and moral, forced on mankind by an inscrutable destiny, 'At last, I know.  After weary travail, I have come to understand.' "
>
> The closing words were attended by a birth of applause.  Charicles bowed gracefully and awaited questions.  But no one raised a hand.  After a moment he turned with relief to the bench before which he had spoken and picked up his robe and his long ivory-headed staff.  At the signal, the audience rose, breaking into conversation.
>
> In a few minutes, the garden emptied.  One man only remained behind, the white-haired man with a ravaged face whom Charicles had observed in the last row.  He worked his way forward, slowly as though lost in thought.
>
> "My name is Elisha," he said abstractedly when he was face to face with the lecturer, "and may I congratulate you on your presentation, especially since I subscribe to it so completely?  In a sense, you have stated my own case."
>
> "Thank you," Charicles smiled his appreciation.
>
> "But," Elisha went on, "I should like to ask you a question."
>
> "By all means," Charicles murmured, feigning interest.
>
> "As you spoke," Elisha continued, quite unaware of the interruption, "Detected a gap in your argument---you left unabridged the interval between innate ideas and the syllogism you quoted.  After all it is a far cry from the assertion that if equals are added to equals the results are equals, and the major premise, 'All men are mortal.'  The former is indeed a judgement of pure reason.  The latter, on the other hand, involves the concepts 'men' and 'mortality' and an inference as to their association---all derived from sense and hence subject to all the uncertainties of physical experience.
>
> "Now my question is this: how do you make the transition from innate ideas to such generalizations at the universal mortality of humanity?  It is just that that has been holding me up in a piece of work of my own, a book...
>
> "What's more," he pressed on as unexpectedly he envisaged a possibility that had never occurred to him before, "even if I concede that a chain of reasoning can be strung over the abyss, there are still unresolved difficulties that have just suggested themselves to me.
>
> "You have posited the validity of the deductive process.  But what happens when you forma  syllogism.  You take major premise A, minor premise B and deduce conclusion C.  You say when you are though that C follows inevitably from A and B.  But what do you mean by that?  Only that you have a sentiment of congruity, and emotion of fittingness.  Are sentiments the stuff of rational demonstration?
>
> "Besides, I have been rereading the skeptical philosophers recently and have been impressed by one of their standard arguments.  Every syllogism, they contend, rests on a first premise.  Either you posit that premise as
