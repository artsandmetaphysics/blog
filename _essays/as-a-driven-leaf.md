## Introduction

Milton Steinberg, an American rabbi, wrote *As a Driven Leaf* and published it in 1939.  It is a novel about Elisha ben Ayubah's exploration of faith and reason that ultimately led to his excommunication.   According to the foreword by Chaim Potok, Elisha's struggles probably paralleled Steinberg's, who was considered a heretic by some.

The book is a tragedy within a tragedy---Elisha's story is set in Palestine and Syria during the Jewish-Roman wars, the last of which lead the death of 580,000 Jews.

I enjoyed the book thoroughly.  The outer story of the Jews within the Roman Empire is vivid, believable, and I can relate to Elisha and his struggles.

Elisha's intellectual journey has three stages:

1. Implicit faith in religion, developed with reason
2. A complete rejection of "faith", and exclusive reliance on reason
3. A considered faith, developed with reason

In this essay I critique arguments presented in four of Elisha's conversations, each occurring at different points along his journey.  

## Conversation After Rejecting Faith

The first conversation is with Akiba, a close friend of Elisha and a fellow rabbi.

> "Elisha, what strange things have you been thinking?  I knew that you were disturbed but I never dreamed it had gone so far.  Am I correct in believing…"
>
> "Yes," came the toneless reply, "everything is gone, not steadily and all the time, but quite generally---everything except for faith in God … I am going to start at the beginning, by laying aside all prejudices, all preconceived notions, all my beliefs and affirmations."
>
> "I am afraid," Akiba faltered, "that I do not understand.  What will be gained if you substitute blanket denial for a wavering faith?"
>
> "Let me put it this way.  We have both studied Euclid's *Elements of Geometry*.  You must have been impressed by the lucidity of the reasoning and the sureness of its results.  For some time, I have been conscious of the contrast between the method of the Greeks and ours.  Their success, I am convinced, followed from the fact that they started from the foundations.  We, on the contrary, have always tried to bolster our pre-established case."

Euclid's *Elements of Geometry* derives a set of theorems (called Euclidean Geometry) from a set of assumptions, or axioms.  Although Euclid's formulation had several flaws, its method remains the basis of mathematics to this day.

Elisha, like most of us, wants his religious beliefs to be as certain as Euclidean geometry.  This approach ultimately fails because he can't find certain axioms to base his religious beliefs on.  We will discuss this in more detail later.

> "Akiba, we have been friends for many years … you must undertake this effort with me.  Let us start at the beginning together."
> 
> "But I still do not understand," Akiba had protested, "how you can expect me to discard beliefs even tentatively if I am really possessed by them.  Your suggestion is like the procedure of those Greek philosophers who say, 'I do not trust my reason, but I will use it to prove that I have no right to use it.' A man may insist that he lays a doctrine aside, but if it is integral to him, he will carry it with him wherever he goes and will inevitably find it again since it has never left him."

Akiba's argument here is invalid.  Our core beliefs can obscure the hidden axioms, or assumptions, in our reasoning, but once identified, we can reason apart from them.  An atheist can realize that the proselytizer may be worried for his soul, and a Muslim can understand why the Qu'ran can not argue for its own validity to a non-believer.

Steinberg may have intended for Akiba to convey that our core beliefs influence which axioms we have faith in.  If this is so, then I agree.  Or perhaps Akiba wants Elisha to recognize that he is putting faith in reason and that we all must put faith in our axioms.  But not axioms are equally "believable."

The believability of axioms is a vague concept.  If we also take "reason" as an axiom, believability is debatable (without reason we are lost).  Still, it is ultimately up to the individual to have faith in what they find most "believable," despite not having mathematical certainty, and to implicitly or explicitly answer the ethical question.

> "The purpose of life," said Akiba softly, "is to live well.  Whatever contributes toward that end is right and true.  My first and last criterion concerning my proposition is: Does it help men live better?  You may remember a lecture in which I asserted 'All is foreseen by God, yet man possesses freedom of will.' "
>
> "But Akiba…"
>
> "Hear me out, Elisha, please.  I am aware that, judged by the logic of Aristotle, my thesis is a contradiction in terms.  But there is a higher logic, a rationality that springs from the necessities of human nature.  Does not man face life with greater assurance if he believes that a benevolent providence foresees the future?  And yet he must at the same time be confident that his will is free, otherwise moral effort is meaningless altogether.  Doctrines in themselves are not important to me, but their consequences are.  For example, I urge upon men that they regard themselves as embodiments of the divine essence.  If I convince them, their days are endowed with a sense of abiding significance and unturning glory.  Then not all the misfortunes and degradations to which they may be subjected can take from them their feeling of oneness with angels and stars.  And as for our people, persecuted and dispersed, they live under the shadow of death, cherishing a dream that is recurrently shattered by the caprice of tyrants and then dreamed again half in despair.  What can enable such a people to persist except a conviction of a special relationship to God?"
>
> "And the objective truth of that conviction?" Elisha broke in impatiently.
>
> "A large and terrible question, I grant.  Nevertheless, the first and ultimate consideration, I insist, must be of effects.  If any doctrine enlarges life, then it possesses truth in realms beyond Aristotle's logic."
>
> "… Yours is a good principle to be sure.  Alas, it proves too much.  It justifies everything and its opposite.  What is more, you know as well as I that if there be no God, it is a lie to speak about Him no matter how well such a falsehood functions.  And your readiness to believe, your willingness to accept doctrines on blind faith and then to defend them on grounds of expediency …"
>
> "By what right," Akiba protested, "do you presume to call my attitude blind?  Belief need not be unseeing.  Is it a darkening of council to admit that truth is not a matter of the mind alone, but of the heart and experience also?  Since it cannot be obtained by reason unaided, faith is indispensable both as a base on which thought may stand, and as a check-rein when logic goes astray.

When Akiba claims that "any doctrine enlarges life, then it possesses truth", I think he means that the truth of your axioms is indicated by the ethical outcomes they produce.  This view presupposes the central importance of humans and how they act.  I think this can be a tenable position, but before discussing further, I will define some terms.

I think the three primary questions (and their loosely defined field of philosophy) are:

- Metaphysics --- What is the nature of reality?
- Epistemology --- How does one know?
- Ethics --- What should I do?

Most philosophies (or worldviews) answer these questions recursively.  For example, the modern scientific worldview is recursive:  The laws of nature describe how our bodies sense the world and these senses are deemed the basis of all knowledge---including the laws of nature.   Thus our metaphysics informs our epistemology which informs our metaphysics.

The recursion between epistemology and metaphysics seems unavoidable.  Ethics, on the other hand, is typically derived from the other two fields.  But it doesn't have to be---Akiba argues that ethics can inform epistemology.  Here is an expanded form of his argument:

1. Humans and how they live are of utmost importance.
2. The universe should be consistent with this importance.
3. Judaism makes people live well, so it is more likely true.

This argument is unconvincing unless you agree with the first two axioms, but it is internally consistent.

Akiba's comments about the difficulty of removing oneself from his beliefs apply; a religious person may not be aware of their axioms when deciding what to believe.  They are apparent once disclosed, but the collective validity of the axioms and anything deduced from them is still unclear.

For ethics to affect metaphysics or epistemology, we must assume that humans (or conscious beings generally) are special.  This importance may be justified if one believes we have souls or that the creator is especially interested in the organization of our brain matter.  These metaphysical claims are possible.  If we are not special in *some* sense, however, then ethics must be isolated from metaphysics and epistemology.

I think one of the thesis of *As a Drive Leaf* is that ethics should inform our epistemology and our metaphysics.  Besides Akiba's arguments, Milton Steinberg hints that the Jewish survival through so much terrible persecution over the years contributes to the Jewish religious tradition's validity.

Akiba has a few more interesting comments:

> "He who wishes to trace a circle must first select out of all space one point about which to draw it. … The utility of the circle in practice will determine ultimately whether the point has been well placed.  So with faith.  It is the axis about which we move---an axis that must be posited as an act of will.  The fate of man determines whether he has located it properly.  That is all I am saying---that belief is the beginning, that it may be tested by experience, but that it must exist, or nothing can be."

Akiba is aware of the truth that Elisha has not yet discovered, that some faith is unavoidable.

It is interesting to note that Akiba considers faith "an act of will"---most Christians also believe this.  I think it is only partially true;  if a belief seems highly implausible, will can not produce faith.

## Conversation While Rejecting Faith

The second essay is between Elisha and Demonax---a philosopher who has decided to focus more on ethics than metaphysics.  It takes place while Elisha remains confident in the power of reason.

> "Let me explain," Demonax continued.  "To you philosophy is a science.  To me it is an art.  To you it is a method of discovering truth.  To me it is a guide to noble living … I am the expositor not of a theory but of a skill.  As a flute teacher imparts his art, first by personal example and then by simple, practical principles, without too much concern over the nature of sound, so I attempt to influence people to live beautifully by striving to live so myself, and by communicating those rules of conduct that have stood the test of time."
>
> "But," Elisha demurred, "no art can be entirely divorced from theory."
>
> "Perfectly true," Demonax replied.  "That is why I have some interest in metaphysics, but only in the barest and most essential minimum of it.  It is guidance in their behavior which men need, a vision of immediate, attainable objective to which they can dedicate themselves, not high-flown schemes of reality.  Of the latter a man has enough if he attains to a reasonable belief in God and a fairly consistent picture of the universe and man's role in it."
>
> "But even that minimum," Elisha protested, "must be thought through.  You would not say that men should accept belief in God unless first they have reasoned their way to it clearly, consistently and indisputably.  Or that they ought to adopt a code of morality unless they have convinced themselves of its validity."
>
> "… I have studied all the major metaphysical systems with care and found not a single issue which they have demonstrated absolutely.  To make matters worse, there is not one conclusion on which they agree."

Elisha thinks that reason is sufficient, while Demonax has realized what Akiba realized, which is that we can not find a firm foundation for our beliefs.

Demonax's derision towards "high-flown schemes of reality" is likely a reference to Aristotle's *Organon*, which divided reality into ten categories: substance, quantity, quality, relation, place, time, situation, condition, action, and passion.

> "But after all," Elisha objected, "there is just as little agreement in the realm of practical principle [applied ethics] as in that of theory [metaphysics].  Your own argument can be turned against you …"
>
> "You are right," he said.  "I am not altogether logical.  Here I tell you that the quest after metaphysical certainty is not worth while because after several centuries of effort it has not attained its objectives.  And at the very same moment I say that one ought to devote his efforts to teaching people how to behave although there is no agreement as to the better life and, so far as we are aware, no one has ever lived it in its completeness.  But the contradiction is not mine.  It is nature's.  The human scene is not some philosopher's garden, but a confusing, dark struggle.  Through its noise and obscurity men grope, all seeking for serenity, few finding it.  And some of us, though we have not completely demonstrated our principles, believe that we know how they may make themselves both better and happier.  Can we withdraw into books and their abstrusities when men need insight into their souls, balms for their wounds, and healing of their sorrows? …"
>
> "But if so," Elisha cried out, "it will go on forever.  If they possess no certainty and are never fully convinced of anything men will always take refugee in aphorisms and maxims.  I am not insensitive to human suffering, but the slow cure is sometimes the surer … only if there be first an indisputable interpretation of reality and a moral system drawn from it, will men be able to live, as engineers and architects work, with assurance."

## Conversation While Realizing the Necessity of Faith

The second is between Elisha and a philosopher who, like Elisha, believes we can develop a firm metaphysical foundation---this conversation is when Elisha looses faith in his metaphysical foundation.

> "… Let us admit," he declaimed, his speech flowing on, his face a mask of assumed interest, "that the senses are not trustworthy since objects appear of different sizes and shapes to different people, and are perceived variously by the same person as he changes his position; since what is brown to one man is red to another, and without hue to the color-blind; since the identical surface will feel coarse or smooth, warm or cold, depending on the sensitivity of the hand that comes into contact with it.  Let us concede even that the whole of our experience is but a phantasm.  A somewhat embarrassing assumption, to be sure, suggesting that neither you nor I may be really here, making you my pleasant dream and me, with my interminable talk, as nightmare to you, from which you cannot awaken too quickly."
>
> Charicles took a deep breath and waited for the restrained laughter to subside.  As was his practice, he began again before quiet was entirely restored.  His sonorous voice rang out across the waning mirth as though he were too impatient to wait.
>
> "But does that mean that there is no certainty, that accurate knowledge is and must forever remain unattainable?
>
> "Not so.  The skeptic lies, and here and now I throw his falsehood into his leering face.  The truth can be won, provided one knows where to seek it and how to move toward it.  For there is another method, independent of the sense---the technique of the founders of great philosophical systems of all times, the approach outlined in the *Organon* of Aristotle---the deductive process whereby one moves from lucid simple first premises through syllogisms to conclusions, more complicated but equally unequivocal and undeniable.
>
> "See," he urged, "how generous nature has been with us, equipping our minds from birth with sure truths for which we need not labor and which no sane person ever challenges.  Will the boldest skeptic deny that two and two equal four, no more, no less; that the whole is the sum of its parts; that equals, added to equals, yield equals; that every effect must have a cause; that A cannot be B and its opposite at the same time, that …?  But why belabor so obvious a point  Each of you can list dozens, hundreds, perhaps thousands of principles of like character.
>
> "Nature, I have said, has been kindly with us.  A grotesque understatement.  More than generous, she has been munificent.  For, in addition to innate verities of the type I have just described, she has furnished us with the instruments of logic whereby we may through our own efforts derive from her original gift limitless treasures of larger richeness.
>
> "Can there be any conclusion but one to the sequence:
>
> > "All men are mortal;
> >
> > "Socrates is a man;
> >
> > "Therefore Socrates is mortal?
>
> "Yet, deep within you, there is, I know , an unspoken question.  If their truth may be attained, you ask how comes it that after generations it does not lie full-blown in our hands.  Ah, my friends, let us knot, in our disappointment, exaggerate.  There are realms where certainty is ours already--areas of mathematics, physics, and even of metaphysics where old insistent riddles have been solved for all time.  And as for the remaining areas of human interest, there too, we are not without hope, provided always that we posses a triad of virtues---caution, probity and patience---caution in our selection of first premises, probity in the deductions from the them, and, greatest of the three, patience.  It is for lack of this last that the most colossal blunders have been made in the past.  Too often have men, despising in their wishful impetuosity slow, safe plodding, overleaped all that intervened in a direct flight to their destination---only to find that they had arrived not at truth but illusion.
>
> "It is, men of Antioch, of the part of wisdom to learn, but not to be discouraged, by experience.  Let us then restrain our eager hearts, discipline our restless minds and we shall together penetrate ever further the frontiers of the doubtful and the unintelligible.
>
> "Patience, my friends, an someday we, and if not we, our children or our children's children will yet be able to say in response to the choices, intellectual and moral, forced on mankind by an inscrutable destiny, 'At last, I know.  After weary travail, I have come to understand.' "
>
> The closing words were attended by a birth of applause.  Charicles bowed gracefully and awaited questions.  But no one raised a hand.  After a moment he turned with relief to the bench before which he had spoken and picked up his robe and his long ivory-headed staff.  At the signal, the audience rose, breaking into conversation.
>
> In a few minutes, the garden emptied.  One man only remained behind, the white-haired man with a ravaged face whom Charicles had observed in the last row.  He worked his way forward, slowly as though lost in thought.
>
> "My name is Elisha," he said abstractedly when he was face to face with the lecturer, "and may I congratulate you on your presentation, especially since I subscribe to it so completely?  In a sense, you have stated my own case."
>
> "Thank you," Charicles smiled his appreciation.
>
> "But," Elisha went on, "I should like to ask you a question."
>
> "By all means," Charicles murmured, feigning interest.
>
> "As you spoke," Elisha continued, quite unaware of the interruption, "Detected a gap in your argument---you left unabridged the interval between innate ideas and the syllogism you quoted.  After all it is a far cry from the assertion that if equals are added to equals the results are equals, and the major premise, 'All men are mortal.'  The former is indeed a judgement of pure reason.  The latter, on the other hand, involves the concepts 'men' and 'mortality' and an inference as to their association---all derived from sense and hence subject to all the uncertainties of physical experience.
>
> "Now my question is this: how do you make the transition from innate ideas to such generalizations at the universal mortality of humanity?  It is just that that has been holding me up in a piece of work of my own, a book…
>
> "What's more," he pressed on as unexpectedly he envisaged a possibility that had never occurred to him before, "even if I concede that a chain of reasoning can be strung over the abyss, there are still unresolved difficulties that have just suggested themselves to me.
>
> "You have posited the validity of the deductive process.  But what happens when you forma  syllogism.  You take major premise A, minor premise B and deduce conclusion C.  You say when you are though that C follows inevitably from A and B.  But what do you mean by that?  Only that you have a sentiment of congruity, and emotion of fittingness.  Are sentiments the stuff of rational demonstration?
>
> "Besides, I have been rereading the skeptical philosophers recently and have been impressed by one of their standard arguments.  Every syllogism, they contend, rests on a first premise.  Either you posit that premise as

Euclidean geometry is useful because it is a good model of physical space.  This utility made Elisha believe that it gives us certain knowledge of reality.  But its certainty is only as good as universe's geometry is not Euclidean.  Thus, the certainty Elisha found in Euclid is isolated from reality because we don't know whether its axioms describe reality.  This is the case for all mathematical knowledge.

Thus, although the logical derivations in Euclid are a valid approach (if you assume the laws of logic are correct), they are only useful if you have sound axioms.  And finding absolutely certain axioms for metaphysical or ethical derivations is not possible.

## Converation After Co

The final conversation is between Elisha and Meir, his favorite student, many years later.

## Conclusion
