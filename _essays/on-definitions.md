In everyday conversation, we assume others use words like ourselves.  This assumption is usually valid, however, often we are unable to define the words we use.

> If you show a picture to a three-year-old and ask if there is a tree in it, you will likely get the correct answer.  If you ask a thirty-year-old what the definition of a tree is, you will likely get an inconclusive answer.  We didn't learn what a tree is by studying the mathematical definition of trees.  We learned it by looking at trees.

It is difficult to define words because they can be used in many ways, depending on the context.

When a veterinarian asks whether a recently sedated dog is conscious, we know they are asking if the dog is a awake.  When a contemplative person asks whether a dog is conscious, we know they are asking if the dog's mind is somehow like a human's mind.

A botanist is told by their friend to "turn right after the fourth tree."  They know when to turn, despite the second and third plants being shrubs.

The same word can have many meanings.  The word "conscious" can mean awake, or self-aware.  The word "tree" can mean a tree in the everyday usage, or a tree in the scientific usage.  We infer the appropriate use from context.

Another problem with definitions is that they are often recursive.

In the same dictionary we have:

- **consciousness**: the fact of awareness by the mind of itself and the world
- **self-aware**: having conscious knowledge of one's own character and feelings.

Recursive definitions are especially problematic in philosophical discussions, due to their often abstract nature.  Yet philosophical discussions greatly benefit from precise and shared definitions.  I have had heated conversations resolve when both sides put aside the debate for a moment to define their words, only then to realize they had been agreeing all along!

I think this is one of the reasons why many philosophical treatises begin by defining their terms.  Philosophical definitions are different than the definitions we find in a dictionary.  A formal definition is an intended equivalence between a word and other words.

The definition of the word "definition" is seen to have two uses.  The first is the standard definition---"what people usually mean."  The second is a formal, almost mathematical, equivalence between a word and other words.  A standard definition is wrong when it is, in fact, not what people usually mean.  For example, a book does not mean "yellow fruit".  On the other hand, a formal definition can not be wrong---it can only be useless.  We can formally define the word "book" to mean "yellow fruit" if we like, but it is not very useful.  This distinction between standard definitions and formal definitions is often obscured because, to aid our memory, we often provide formal definitions for words that are very similar to that same word's standard definition.

Words that are too broad or too narrow are not useful for making distinctions.  Groups of people with more specific purposes may need more narrowly defined words.  Specialists in many fields develop lingo to distinguish objects at a level of granularity not required by non-specialists.
