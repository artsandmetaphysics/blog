In everyday conversation, we assume others use words like ourselves.  This assumption is usually valid, however, often we are unable to define the words we use.

> If you show a picture to a three-year-old and ask if there is a tree in it, you will likely get the correct answer.  If you ask a thirty-year-old what the definition of a tree is, you will likely get an inconclusive answer.  We didn't learn what a tree is by studying the mathematical definition of trees.  We learned it by looking at trees.

It is difficult to define words because they can be used in many ways, depending on the context.

When a veterinarian asks whether a recently sedated dog is conscious, we know they are asking if the dog is a awake.  When a contemplative person asks whether a dog is conscious, we know they are asking if the dog's mind is somehow like a human's mind.

A botanist is told by their friend to "turn right after the fourth tree."  They know when to turn, despite the second and third plants being shrubs.

The same word can have many meanings.  The word "conscious" can be used as in "awake", or as in "self-aware".  The word "tree" can be used in the everyday sense, or in the scientific sense. We infer which use is meant from context.

Another problem with definitions is that they are often recursive.

In the same dictionary we have:

- consciousness: the fact of awareness by the mind of itself and the world
- self-aware: having conscious knowledge of one's own character and feelings.

Recursive definitions are especially problematic in philosophical discussions, due to their often abstract nature.  Yet philosophical discussions greatly benefit from precise and shared definitions.  I have had heated conversations resolve when both sides put aside the debate for a moment to define their words, only then to realize they had been agreeing all along!

I think this is one of the reasons why many philosophical treatises begin by defining their terms.

There are two useful questions we can ask about definitions.

1. Is it useful for a given purpose?
2. Is it what was meant, in a particular context?

Words that are too broad or too narrow are not useful for making distinctions.  Groups of people with more specific purposes may need more narrowly defined words.  Specialists in many fields develop lingo to distinguish objects at a level of granularity not required by non-specialists.
