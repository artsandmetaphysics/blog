Hell, as described by Dante in *The Divine Comedy*, is filled with people being tortured forever by demons.  Why does God allow the demons to torture people forever---is it so that he can be just?

Hell, as described by C. S. Lewis in *The Great Divorce*, is filled with people who decided they don't want to be with God.  Why does God allow the non-believers to continue existing?  Why have a hell at all?  It makes sense that they can not be allowed into Heaven, but must they exist forever, miserable in their eternal separateness from Him?   Instead of letting non-believers choose Hell, God could simply erase them from existence.  Why doesn't he?
