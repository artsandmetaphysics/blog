The word "faith", as commonly used, has religious connotations.  I define and use the word "faith" outside of religious connotations.

Many people have an ill-defined and unconsidered worldview, but we have them none-the-less, and our choices imply what they are.  Our worldviews may be inconsistent.

Upon evaluation, we can divide our worldview into a set of axioms and a set of beliefs derived from these axioms.  The axioms are by definition unprovable.  I define "faith" as our willingness to act consistently with our axioms, despite them being uncertain.

I think we have degrees of faith, depending on how drastically we would alter how we live if we did not hold the belief we have faith in.

We all have "faith" in the constency of the laws of nature, but it is a low degree of faith because even if we believed they may change at any instant, we would not drastically alter how we act.  Perhaps we would live more in the moment, and would save less for retirement.

If we believe we may go to hell if we have sex outside of marriage, then we have a degree of faith depending on how much we want to have sex outside of marriage.  If this isn't a temptation for us, then perhaps it requires very little faith.

If we believe we should donate 10% of our money to the church, then we have a significant degree of faith, since this is quite a sacrifice for most people who are not very wealthy.

If we believe we should fly a plane into a building, then we have an extreme level of faith---without this much faith we are very unlikely to act in this way.

By this definition, believers that don't act consistently with their religion have very little faith.  Thus, I conclude that most Christians in America do not have much faith, since they act like most agnostics in America.
