description: Faith in beliefs is indicated by how drastically our actions change as a result of our belief.

We all have a worldview---a collection of beliefs that guide our actions.  Our worldview may be ill-defined and poorly considered.  It may even be inconsistent!  Still, if we have reasoned about how to act, we have a worldview of some sort.

Upon evaluation, we could divide the set of beliefs that form our worldview into two groups:

1. A set of irreducible, unprovable axioms
2. A set of beliefs deduced from these axioms

I define "faith" as our willingness to act *and possibly think* consistently with our axioms, despite them being uncertain and unprovable.

The degrees of faith in a particular belief is proportional to how drastically abandoning this belief would alter how we act and think.  To illustrate what I mean by degrees of faith, I will discuss four instances of increasingly high degrees of faith.

Most humans believe that the laws of nature will continue acting as they have in the past, although we can not prove this belief.  Many of us adopt this belief unconsciously.  Thus, my definition of faith applies even to unconsidered beliefs, which does not fit with some religions which consider faith an "act of the will."  I call this implicit faith---faith which is seen only in a person's actions, but not in their thoughts.

A belief in the consistency of nature requires low degree of faith because, even if we believed otherwise, we would not drastically alter thoughts or actions; we may live more in the moment, and we may open-minded towards other beliefs, but we would save less for retirement.

If we believe we may go to hell if we have sex outside of marriage, then we have a degree of faith depending on how much we want to have sex outside of marriage.  If this isn't a temptation for us, then perhaps it requires very little faith.

If we believe we should donate 10% of our money to the church, then we have a significant degree of faith, since this is quite a sacrifice for most people who are not very wealthy.

If we believe we should fly a plane into a building, then we have an extreme level of faith---without this much faith we are very unlikely to act in this way.

By this definition, believers that don't act consistently with their religion have very little faith.  Thus, I conclude that most Christians in America do not have much faith, since they act like most agnostics in America.
