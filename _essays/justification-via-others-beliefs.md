We justify our beliefs using sensory knowledge, reasoning, memories, intuition, emotion, and other means.

Should we justify our beliefs using other's beliefs?

Does Einstein's belief that P justify my belief that P?

Imagine we ask Einstein why he believes that P, and he tells us J.  If we think J is valid, we may justify our belief that P using J too.  In this case, we are _not_ using Einstein's _belief_ to justify our own, rather we are considering his justification and adopting or rejecting it for ourself.  This distinction is important.

But what if we are unable to consider Einstein's justification, J, for ourself?  In this situation, could we justify our belief that P using the fact that Einstein beliefs that P, without being aware of J?

I believe that, due to time-constraints, sometimes we must rely on other's beliefs to justify our own.

For example, someone may believe that the sun is a fiery ball of hydrogen undergoing nuclear reactions.  They may justify this belief because their science teacher also believes it, even if they don't understand their teacher's justification.

Whenever we justify our beliefs using other's beliefs, we open ourselves up to two problems:

1. The other person is mistaken.
2. The other person is deceiving us.

If we take the time to understand the other person's justification, we may rule out the second problem.  We can not rule out the first problem, however, because we may be mistaken ourself.

Three points:

1. Many other people
2. A combination (partially considering the other person's justification)
3. Who is the other person?  Experts and credentials.

And of course, the likelihood of these problems occurring depends on who the other person is.
