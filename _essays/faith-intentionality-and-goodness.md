title: Faith, Intentionality, and Goodness
description: Does doubt increase righteousness?

Christians ethics place emphasis on the intent and the situation behind the action.

Imagine two people performing a charitable deed.  The first person acts unintentionally, the second acts intentionally.  Which person is better?

Now imagine a Christian with rock-solid faith and someone who wants to be good, but does not know what they believe.  Both perform a charitable act.  Which person is better?
