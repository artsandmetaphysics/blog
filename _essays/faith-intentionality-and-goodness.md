title: Faith, Intentionality, and Goodness
description: Does doubt increase righteousness?
---
Two people do the same good deed---the first unintentionally, the second intentionally.  Which deed is more righteous?

Two people live equally charitable lives---the first is a Christian with a strong faith, the second in the face of uncertainty.  Which person is more righteous?

The faithless may be more righteous then the faithful, but are condemned anyway.
