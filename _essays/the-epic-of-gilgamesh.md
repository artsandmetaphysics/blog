Ancient and beautiful, *The Epic of Gilgamesh* is the story of the king of Uruk.

Gilgamesh was a powerful and handsome king, but he oppressed his people.  He forced new brides to have sex with him on their wedding night.  The young women of Uruk cried out, and the gods heard them.  The gods decided to create the wildman Enkidu to vie with Gilgamesh and to relieve Uruk's citizens:

<blockquote class="poetry">The goddess Aruru, she washed her hands,
    took a pinch of clay, threw it down in the wild.
In the wild she created Enkidu, the hero,
    offspring of silence, knit strong by Ninurta.</blockquote>

A game trapper finds Enkidu at a watering hole, and is concerned because he fills in his pits and pulls up his snares.  The trapper's father advises his son to bring Shamhat, a harlot from Uruk, to the watering hole to tempt Enkidu with her charms.  Here is the scene where Shamhat tempts Enkidu, and tells him to leave the wilderness and his animals:

<blockquote class="poetry">One day and a second they waited by the water-hole,
    then the herd came down to drink the water.
The game arrived, their hearts <em>delighted in</em> water,
    and Enkidu also, born in the uplands.

With the gazelles he grazed on grasses,
    <em>joining the throng</em> with the game at the water-hole,
his heart <em>delighting</em> with the beasts in the water:
    then Shamhat saw him, the child of nature,
the savage man from the midst of the wild.

...

Shamhat unfastened the cloth of her loins,
    she bared her sex and he took in her charms.
She did not recoil, she took in his scent:
    she spread her clothing and he lay upon her.

She did for the man the work of a woman,
    his passion caressed and embraced her.
For six days and seven nights
    Enkidu was erect, as he coupled with Shamhat.

When with her delights he was fully sated,
    he turned his gaze to his herd.
The gazelles saw Enkidu, they started to run,
    the beasts of the field shied away from his presence.

Enkidu had defiled his body so pure,
    his legs stood still, though his herd was in motion.
Enkidu was weakened, could not run as before,
    but now he had <em>reason</em>, and wide understanding.

He came back and sat at the feet of the harlot,
    watching the harlot, observing her features.
Then to the harlot's words he listened intently,
    <em>as Shamhat</em> talked to him, to Enkidu:

'You are handsome, Enkidu, you are just like a god!
    Why with the beasts do you wander the wild?
Come, I will take you to Uruk-the-Sheepfold,
    to the sacred temple, home of Anu and Ishtar</blockquote>

I am quoting from the Andrew George translation; words in italics were difficult to decipher or were filled in from context.

This passage has similarities to the Adam and Eve story in the Book of Genesis.  In both a man is created from the ground, tempted by a woman, succumbs, gains knowledge or understanding, and must leave their innocent way of life.

There are more differences between the stories than there are similarities.  Eve was the innocent partner of Adam; Shamhat was a prostitute from the city.  Adam and Eve tended a garden and named the animals, while Enkidu would run with the animals and free them from traps.  Enkidu was "defiled" and gained "wide understanding," while Adam gained "knowledge of good and evil."  Eve was tempted with knowledge by a snake, and then Eve tempted Adam; Enkidu was tempted with sex by Shamhat.

There is, however, a snake in the *Epic of Gilgamesh.* Gilgamesh is returning from a journey with a plant that will make him young again.  This plant is similar to the tree of life in Genesis.  Here is the passage:

<blockquote class="poetry">'This plant, Ur-shanabi, is the "Plant of Heartbeat",
    with it a man can regain his vigour.
To Uruk-the-Sheepfold I will take it,
    to an ancient I will feed some and put the plant to the test!

'Its name shall be "Old Man Grown Young",
    I will eat it myself, and be again as I was in my youth!'
At twenty leagues they broke bread,
    at thirty leagues they stopped for the night.

Gilgamesh found a pool whose water was cool,
    down he went into it, to bathe in the water.
Of the plant's fragrance a snake caught scent,
    came up <em>in silence</em>, and bore the plant off.

As it turned away it sloughed its skin.
    Then Gilgamesh sat down and wept,
down his cheeks the tears were coursing.</blockquote>

In both stories a snake causes a man to lose access to a plant which provides eternal life.  However, there are many differences.  In Genesis, the plant is given to Adam by God; Gilgamesh is told about the plant by the Babylonian Noah and he must find it himself.  In Genesis, the plant is a tree in the garden of Eden; in the *Epic of Gilgamesh,* it is a prickly plant at the bottom of the "Ocean Below."

There are enough similarities between the two stories that I believe one of the following statements must be true

- Genesis was influenced by *The Epic of Gilgamesh*
- *The Epic of Gilgamesh* was influenced by Genesis
- Both stories had a common source.
