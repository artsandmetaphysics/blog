To distinguish ethical progress, regress, and mere change, we need a common ethics.

Ethics is situational; to judge the past we need to know and understand it more than we often can.

Ethical progress can occur in both individuals and societies.

It is difficult to discern ethical progress from technological progress.  Ethics is the study of how one should act in a given situation.  Technological progress will alter the type and frequency of situations that individuals and societies face.  For example, medical technology has given rise to many new situations.

Ethical progress is easier to measure in societies than in individuals because individuals face fewer situations.

Imagine a situation, which we can call S.  There are two choices that an individual in situation S can make, R and W.  Choice R is the right choice.

Imagine that a person is faced with situation S ten times during their life.

Now imagine a society filled with thousands of people, each facing situation S approximately ten times in their lives.

The discrete nature of the choices make progress easier to measure, and less susceptible to random variations, when there are more situations being considered.

Progress can be made in a certain type of situation or group of situation.  A society progress and treat their disadvantaged individuals better, while the average person is more selfish in their lives.
