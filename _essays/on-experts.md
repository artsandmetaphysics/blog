Can we use other's beliefs to justify our own?

Does Einstein's belief that P justify my belief that P?

Imagine we ask Einstein why he believes that P, and he tells us J.  If we think J is valid, we may justify our belief that P using J too.

Now imagine that J is very complicated.  Perhaps it would require us taking several college courses to understand, or perhaps it is beyond our mental ability, or perhaps we are simply busy.  Could we justify our belief that P using the fact that Einstein beliefs that P, without being aware of J?

We must, because we have limited time and limited intelligence, but when we do, our

But when we do, we
Sometimes it may be appropriate, however, it is a shortcut that leaves one open to several traps.

When we don't have the time or ability to justify our belief directly, we can.
I think that sometimes we should, but usually we should not.  Instead, we should consider how others *justify* their beliefs, and

- We often listen to why other people believe what they belief, and if we think their justification is good, we may adopt the belief ourself.  In other words, we may think their justification is valid, so we justify our own belief in the same (or similar thing) in the same manner.
- A justification is more complicated that the belief itself.  I believe the sun is a fiery ball of hydrogen undergoing nuclear reactions.  My justification for this belief is complicated and probably somewhat recursive.
- There are many types of justification we may use.  Reason, logic, raw sensory input.  See chart.
- Is another's belief a valid form of justification?  Note, we do NOT mean the other person's justifications.  We mean the mere presence of the other person's belief?
- It can be valid.  We have limited time and mental ability.
- However, whenever we do it, we leave ourselves open to a variety of traps.
  - First of all, how do we know what the other person beliefs?  They may be trying to mislead us.
  - Second of all, they may be mistaken.
- Without knowing the other person's justification for their belief, and evaluating the evidence for ourselves, we can not really be sure if either of these two problems are occurring.
- Also, even if spend the time to learn the other person's justification, we may end up being mistaken too.  Although we can at least rule out the possibility of being mislead.
- Still, there are ways to reduce the possibility of these two problems from occurring.
- One approach is to identify an expert; credentials.  We figure out that this person is widely respected by other people (which is of course, recursive---because this respect is itself justifying belief that the other person is an expert based on other people's beliefs).  If the person is truly an expert, it is less likely that they will be mistaken.  We can also use psychology to figure out whether the person has motives for misleading us.
- Given time and mental ability constraints, it may not be possible to do better than this.
- Still, it is always a shortcut.  It is possible that it doesn't mislead us.  E.g., we may have completely correct beliefs while justifying a lot of it based on other's beliefs.  However, the more we do this, the more likely we are to be misled somehow.

- Definitions
  - Belief:
  - Justification:
- e.g. Einstein is an Atheist, and Einstein is really smart, so Atheism is probably correct.
- Knowledge derived from other people
- Time
  - not enough time to learn everything
  - use other people as a "shortcut"
  - shortcut for deciding what "hypothesis" to investigate (which mountain to climb)
  - shortcut for learning (take their word for what is at the top)
- Difficulty
  - a lot of "knowledge" is too difficult to figure out on our own
  - e.g. deriving the tenants of geometry from scratch is very difficult
  - there is knowledge that, once grasped, is clearly true---but it would be difficult to come up with by ones self
  - other knowledge is unclear; even after hearing all of the evidence, its not clear what the "right" answer is
- Ways to know things
  - Sensory input
  - Reason; rationalism---knowledge comes from reason (mostly?, only?)
  - Intuition; this is a vague word; its not clear
  - Revelation; holy books, inspiration from God/gods
  - Faith;
    - deciding to trust in other's revelations?
    - is faith a way of justifying belief, not arriving at knowledge
  - Emotion; its not clear how this is different from intuition
- aside. "the well informed patient knows more than the doctor"
  - an individual can be an expert in a small part of a larger field
  - in this essay, we are discussing "true" experts of the issue at hand
- What fields are difficult to become experts in
  - Fields that are inaccessible without a lot of background; science and broad trends in history
  - Fields that are easy to become experts in: art, wine, history of something very specific
- Problems with experts
  - Motives in the experts
  - Motives in ourselves
- One other person; many other people
- How do we know whether another person is an expert?
  - It must be easier to determine whether they are an expert, than it is to learn the thing itself.
- How do we know what another person really beliefs?
  - Their actions


Model of knowledge.  Not perfect, just a framework to think within.

Statement: a statement about the world that is either true or false.

Belief: an individual's expression that they think a particular statement is true or false.  The belief is false if the underlying statement is false, and true if the underlying statement is true.

How can we know somebody's belief?  Ultimately, we can't.  The best we can do is look at their actions.
