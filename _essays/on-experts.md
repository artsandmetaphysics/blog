Should the opinion of experts to justify beliefs?
Should we use other's beliefs to justify our own?


- e.g. Einstein is an Atheist, and Einstein is really smart, so Atheism is probably correct.
- Knowledge derived from other people
- Time
  - not enough time to learn everything
  - use other people as a "shortcut"
  - shortcut for deciding what "hypothesis" to investigate (which mountain to climb)
  - shortcut for learning (take their word for what is at the top)
- Difficulty
  - a lot of "knowledge" is too difficult to figure out on our own
  - e.g. deriving the tenants of geometry from scratch is very difficult
  - there is knowledge that, once grasped, is clearly true---but it would be difficult to come up with by ones self
  - other knowledge is unclear; even after hearing all of the evidence, its not clear what the "right" answer is
- Ways to know things
  - Sensory input
  - Reason; rationalism---knowledge comes from reason (mostly?, only?)
  - Intuition; this is a vague word; its not clear
  - Revelation; holy books, inspiration from God/gods
  - Faith;
    - deciding to trust in other's revelations?
    - is faith a way of justifying belief, not arriving at knowledge
  - Emotion; its not clear how this is different from intuition
- aside. "the well informed patient knows more than the doctor"
  - an individual can be an expert in a small part of a larger field
  - in this essay, we are discussing "true" experts of the issue at hand
- What fields are difficult to become experts in
  - Fields that are inaccessible without a lot of background; science and broad trends in history
  - Fields that are easy to become experts in: art, wine, history of something very specific
- Problems with experts
  - Motives in the experts
  - Motives in ourselves
- One other person; many other people
