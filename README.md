# Building

Run `make` to compile static assets.

Start a test server using `run`.

# Typographical Substitutions

- `---` is replaced with an "em dash"
- `--` is replaced with an "en dash"
- `...` at the start of a line is replaced with "centered triple dots"

# Citations

Invisible citations are only displayed when the user hovers over the quote with their mouse or prints the material.

The final line or two of a quote should contain the citation:

- Poetry with a visible citation: `===`
- Poetry with a invisible citation: `==`
- Quote with a invisible citation: `---`
- Quote with a visible citation: `--`

You can include both a visible and invisible citation, e.g. if you want to include more details in the invisible citation.

# References

References are in pseudo form of the Oxford Style.  I prune some stuff that isn't necessary (e.g. who cares about the publisher these days, lots of books are self-published).  See [this site](http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/c.php?g=325241&p=2177430) for examples.
