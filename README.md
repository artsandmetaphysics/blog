Run the make file to compile static assets.

# References

References are in pseudo form of the Oxford Style.  I prune some stuff that isn't necessary (e.g. who cares about the publisher these days, lots of books are self-published).  See [this site](http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/c.php?g=325241&p=2177430) for examples.
