## History

The Egyptian priest Manetho grouped the pharaohs into 31 dynasties. Modern Egyptologists tend to count the early, Macedonian, and Ptolemaic pharaohs as three additional dynasties, resulting in a 34 dynasties.  The dynasties are grouped into periods:

1. Predynastic (5000 - 3000)
2. Early Dynastic (3000 - 2625)
3. Old Kingdom (2625 - 2130)
4. First Intermediate Period (2130 - 1980)
5. Middle Kingdom (1980 - 1630)
6. Second Intermediate Period (1630 - 1539)
7. New Kingdom (1539 - 1075)
8. Third Intermediate Period (1075 - 656)
9. Late Period (664 - 332)
10. Hellenistic Period (332 - 30)
