# Book I

> Herodotus of Halicarnassus here displays his inquiry, so that human achievements may not become forgotten in time, and great and marvellous deeds---some displayed by Greeks, some by barbarians---may not be without their glory; and especially to show why the two peoples fought with each other. <cite>Book I.1</cite>

> Gyges gave a cry of horror.  "Master," he said "what an improper suggestion!  Do you tell me to look at the queen when she has no clothes on?  No, no: 'when she takes off her clothing, she does away with her shame'---you know what they say of women.  Let us learn from experience.  Right and wrong were distinguished long ago---and I'll tell you one thing that is right: a man should mind his own business.  I do not doubt that your wife is the most beautiful of women; so for goodness' sake do not ask me to behave contrary to custom." <cite>Book I.8</cite>

> When Solon had made as thorough an inspection as opportunity allowed, Croesus said: "Well, my Athenian friend, I have heard a great deal about your knowledge.  I cannot resist my desire to ask you a question: who is the happiest man you have ever seen?"
>
> The point of the question was that Croesus supposed himself to be the happiest of men.  Solon, however, refused to flatter, and answered in strict accordance with his view of the truth.  "An Athenian," he said, "called Tellus."
>
> Croesus was taken aback.  "And what," he asked sharply, "is your reason for this choice?"
>
> "There are good reasons," said Solon; "first, his city was prosperous, and he had fine sons, and lived to see children born to each of them, and all these children surviving; secondly, he had wealth enough by our standards; and he had a glorious death. In a battle with the neighboring town of Eleusis, he fought for his countrymen, routed the enemy, and died like a brave man; and the Athenians paid him the high honor of a public funeral on the spot where he fell." <cite>Book I.30</cite>
