Hesiod was one of the most famous Greek poets.  He is not as good a writer as Homer. Still, the ancients often grouped him with Homer as one of the main proponents of the early Greek worldview.

He wrote two short epic poems,  _The Theogony_ and _Works and Days_.

## The Gods

<blockquote class="poetry">It looks like there's not just one kind of Strife—
That's Eris—after all, but two on the Earth.
You'd praise one of them once you got to know her,
But the other's plain blameworthy.  They've just got
Completely opposite temperaments.
One of them favors war and fighting. She's a mean cuss
And nobody likes her, but everybody honors her,
This ornery Eris.  They have to: it's the gods' will.

The other was born first though.  Ebony Night
Bore her, and Kronos' son who sits high in thin air
Set her in Earth's roots, and she's a lot better for humans.
Even shiftless folks she gets stirred up to work.

When a person's lazing about and sees his neighbor
Getting rich, because he hurries to plow and plant
And put his homestead in order, he tends to compete
With that neighbor in a race to get rich.

Strife like this does people good.
<cite>Works and Days, 21–37</cite>

TODO: add other quote about something being a god

Hesiod seems to associated gods with

Three types of gods:

1. Personified gods that were worshiped (e.g., Zeus, Aphrodite, Athena)
2. Personified gods that were not worshiped (e.g., Atlas)
3. Gods which represent abstractions (e.g., Dawn, Neglect, Pretences)

It seemed natural to the Greeks to represent abstract concepts as gods, since they are invisible and immortal.

Strife and Rumour---etymological explanations for gods.

Hesiod uses creation through sex instead of the creation through speech (present in the Hebrew bible and, I think, in Egyptian cosmology).

Genealogy is an organizational scheme.

Hekate (Hesiod's apparent favourite next to Zeus); exemplifies how different cults rise and fade over time.

Hesiod appears to create gods as he goes, sometimes filling them in as necessary.  This is difficult for us to understand, but he believed that the muses were acting through him to fill in the detail.  I.e., he is just a conduit to pass through the thoughts of the muses.

<blockquote class="poetry">That's the sum of my experience with pegged & dowelled ships.
Still, I can teach you the mind of Zeus the Storm King,
Since the Muses have taught me ineffable song.
<cite>Works and Days, 731–733</cite>

## Comparisons with Other Religions

- Hittites
- Babylonians
- Vedic tradition

Marduk has many similarities with Zeus.  Both were sky gods who lead a fight over and older generation of gods to become the leading god.

Pandora and Eve.

Babylonians thought men were created to feed the gods; Greeks, while still giving sacrifies, apparently did not.  Quote about Zeus hiding how to make a living.

Zeus's division of duties and realms vs Marduk's in the Enuma Elish.

## Ages of Men

Possible insertion of the age of Heroes.

Men have gotten weaker (anti-progress).
