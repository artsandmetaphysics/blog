If God needed to send Jesus to be merciful and just when he condemns, but also forgives, sinful humans, then God is bound by an external moral standard.

If God is the standard he would not need to send Jesus—he could have declared by the fact that he defines right and wrong, justice, and mercy that he both condemns sin and forgives us while also being merciful and just.  One logical response would be to say that, although God didn’t need to send Jesus, he sent him because he felt like sending him.
