The writer is not the same person as the Teacher.

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Vanity of vanities, says the Teacher,</p>
<p class="indent">vanity of vanities! All is vanity.</p>
<p>What do people gain from all the toil</p>
<p class="indent">at which they toil under the sun?</p>
<p>A generation goes, and a generation comes,</p>

In the most direct sense, the Teacher is wrong!

Our understanding of they physical world is more correct than that of ancient peoples. The Teacher, as most others in his time, believed that the water from the sea flowed back to the rivers through tunnels in the ground. The Earth itself will someday be destroyed when our sun explodes.

Ecclesiastes is thought to be written between 500 and 300 BCE. The Greeks invented many new ideas during these centuries—ideas that are still affecting the world today.

Since the invention of writing, we remember some famous people from long ago, for example, the king Hammurabi.

In a deeper sense, the Teacher is correct.

Most of us will not be remembered a few hundred years from now and perhaps 10,000 years from now Hammurabi will be less well known.

Perhaps humanity will continue to have new ideas and invent new technologies, but this “progress” will halt eventually. (It seems reasonable that there is a finite number of genuinely new ideas and phenomena for us to discover).

While the Teacher’s understanding of physical reality was incomplete, it seems unlikely that an understanding of modern physics would alter his thinking.

Yet, in the deepest sense, I think the Teacher is wrong.

If our existence is meaningless because it is transient, or because it is not unique, then one must wonder where could meaning possibly come from? I think the only possible answers are that there must be meaning found even within our transient lives or that there is some mystical meta-physical source of meaning which is not found in our finite universe.

Thus, while our existence is but a breath, to be blown away and forgotten, we can find meaning in it or hope that there is a hidden meaning beyond the metaphysical veil.
