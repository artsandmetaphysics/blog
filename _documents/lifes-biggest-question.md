A baby is born and the parents love the baby.<br>
A baby is born and the parents raise the baby.<br>
A baby is born and the parents teach it words.<br>
The words start slowly.<br>
Slowly the words grow longer<br>
And the words grow sharper.<br>
The child is taught to act.<br>
The acts of the child are bad.<br>
The child is taught discipline.<br>
<br>
The child grows into a person.<br>
And this person lives how they please.<br>
Pleasures and pursuits fill its time.<br>
Pain encroaches.<br>
The person looks for meaning<br>
And the person searches for purpose<br>
And asks how to live.<br>
<br>
Religion tells this person how to live.<br>
Religion tells this person what exists<br>
What exists but is not seen.<br>
How do they know?<br>
How do they trust the words of the ancient books,<br>
The words of the ancient books passed down through the ages<br>
The words of the prophets<br>
The words of the priests?<br>
<br>
I want to act well.<br>
I want to not do what I should not do<br>
And do what I should do.<br>
<br>
The words of the priests tell me what to do!<br>
The prophets speak out!<br>
The ancient books speak their wisdom,<br>
But how can I trust their knowledge?<br>
How can I know?<br>
