## Background

*The Iliad* is the greatest Greek epic poem.  The ancients believed that it was composed by the blind poet Homer.  Modern scholars debate when it was composed and by whom, but most agree it was written around 700 BCE.

The poem is about 16,000 lines of hexameter verse in the ancient Greek, and is split into 24 books.

1. Agamemnon and Achilles quarrel; Thetis appeals to Zeus
2. Agamemnon tests the troops; the great gathering of armies
3. Helen reviews the champions; Paris and Menelaus duel
4. Zeus and Hera bicker; the truce erupts in war
5. Diomedes fights Aphrodite, Apollo, and Ares
6. Hector returns to Troy; Diomedes and Glaucus become friends
7. Ajax and Hector to a draw; the Acheaens build a wall
8. Zeus turns the tide; the Trojans camp outside their walls
9. The Embassy to Achilles fails
10. Odyssius and Ajax maraud through the Night
11. Agamemnon’s Day of Glory
12. The Trojans Storm the Rampart
13. Battling for the Ships
14. Hera Outflanks Zeus
15. The Achaean Armies at Bay
16. Patroclus Fights and Dies
17. Menelaus’ Finest Hour
18. The Shield of Achilles
19. The Champion Arms for Battle
20. Olympian Gods in Arms
21. Achilles Fights the River
22. The Death of Hector
23. Funeral Games for Patroclus
24. Achilles and Priam

## The Gods

Some gods are described as human-like while others are abstract.  Gods are born, and humans can fight and harm them, as Diomedes does in Book 5:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>He gouged Aphrodite just where the wristbone joins the palms</p>
<p>and immortal blood came flowing quickly from the goddess,</p>
<p>the ichor that courses through their veins, the blessed gods—</p>
<p>they eat no bread, they drink no shining wine, and so</p>
<p>the gods are bloodless, so we call them deathless. (5.338–42)</p>
</blockquote>

Note that the Greeks associate eating our food with mortality.  This is seen in a number of other verses as well:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“No, my friend,</p>
<p>I have no desire to fight the blithe immortals.</p>
<p>But if you’re a man who eats the crops of the earth,</p>
<p>a mortal born for death—here, come closer,</p>
<p>the sooner you will meet your day to die!” (6.141–4)</p>
</blockquote>

It also seems that the gods can be killed:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>And despite the god’s undying lust for battle</p>
<p>Ares might have wasted away there on the spot</p>
<p>if the monster’s stepmother, beautiful Eriboea</p>
<p>had not sent for Hermes, and out of the cauldron</p>
<p>Hermes stole him away—the War-god breathing his last,</p>
<p>all but broken down by the ruthless iron chains. (5.387–91)</p>
</blockquote>

## Rituals and Customs

The Greeks believed that the gods enjoyed and demanded animal sacrifices and libations:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“I [Zeus] honor sacred Ilium most with my immortal heart:</p>
<p>Priam and men of Priam who hurls the strong ash spear.</p>
<p>Never once did my altar lack its share of victims,</p>
<p>winecups tipped and the deep smoky savor. These,</p>
<p>these are the gifts we claim—they are our rights.” (4.46–9)</p>
</blockquote>

And there were some expectations that the gods would respect their sacrifices.  For example after Zeus turns the tide of battle in Book 8, Agamemnon begins a prayer with this:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“Father Zeus, when did you ever strike a mighty king</p>
<p>with such mad blindness—then tear away his glory?  Not once,</p>
<p>I swear, did I pass some handsome shrine of yours,</p>
<p>sailing my oar-swept ship on our fatal voyage here,</p>
<p>but on each I burned the fat and thighs of oxen,</p>
<p>longing to raze Troy’s sturdy walls to the roots.” (8.234–41)</p>
</blockquote>

The most clearly described animal sacrifice occurs near the beginning of the Iliad:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>At once the men arranged the sacrifice for Apollo,</p>
<p>making the cattle ring his well-built altar,</p>
<p>then they rinsed their hands and took up barley.</p>
<p>Rising among them Chryses stretched his arms to the sky</p>
<p>and prayed in a high resounding voice, “Hear me, Apollo!</p>
<p>God of the silver bow who strides the walls of Chryse</p>
<p>and Cilla sacrosanct—lord in power of Tenedos!</p>
<p>If you honored me last time and heard my prayer</p>
<p>and rained destruction down on all Achaea’s ranks,</p>
<p>now bring my prayer to pass once more. Now, at last,</p>
<p>driving this killing plague from the armies of Achaea!”</p>
<br>
<p>His prayer went up and Phoebus Apollo heard him.</p>
<p>And soon as the men had prayed and flung the barley,</p>
<p>first they lifted back the heads of the victims,</p>
<p>slit their throats, skinned them and carved away</p>
<p>the meat from the thighbones and wrapped them in fat,</p>
<p>a double fold sliced clean and topped with strips of flesh.</p>
<p>And the old man burned these over dried split wood</p>
<p>and over the quarters poured out glistening wine</p>
<p>while young men at his side held five-pronged forks.</p>
<p>Once they had burned the bones and tasted the organs</p>
<p>they cut the rest into pieces, pierced them with spits,</p>
<p>roasted them to a turn and pulled them off the fire.</p>
<p>The work done, the feast laid out, they ate well</p>
<p>and no man’s hunger lacked a share of the banquet.</p>
<p>When they had put aside desire for food and drink,</p>
<p>the young me brimmed the mixing bowls with wine</p>
<p>and tipping first drops for the god in every cup</p>
<p>they poured full rounds for all. And all day long</p>
<p>they appeased the god with song, raising a ringing hymn</p>
<p>to the distant archer god who drives away the plague,</p>
<p>those young Achaean warriors singing out his power,</p>
<p>and Apollo listened, his great heart warm with joy. (1.447–75)</p>
</blockquote>

Plagues and natural disasters were believed to be caused by gods.  An example of this is seen at the beginning of *The Iliad*:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“So home we sail …</p>
<p>if we can escape our death—if war and plague</p>
<p>are joining forces now to crush the Argives.</p>
<p>But wait: let us question a holy man,</p>
<p>a prophet, even a man skilled with dreams—</p>
<p>dreams as well can come our way from Zeus—</p>
<p>come, someone tell us why Apollo rages so,</p>
<p>whether he blames us for a vow we failed, or sacrifice.</p>
<p>If only the god would share the smoky savor of lambs</p>
<p>and full-grown goats, Apollo might be willing, still,</p>
<p>somehow, to save us from this plague.” (1.58-67)</p>
</blockquote>

## The Rage of Achilles

Traditionally, the first word of an epic poem is also its central theme.  Here is the first line of the Iliad:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Rage—Goddess, sing the rage of Peleus’ son Achilles,</p>
<p>murderous, doomed, that cost the Achaeans countless losses,</p>
<p>hurling down to the House of Death so many sturdy souls,</p>
<p>great fighters’ souls, but made their bodies carrion,</p>
<p>feasts for the dogs and birds,</p>
<p>and the will of Zeus was moving towards its end.</p>
<p>Begin, Muse, when the two first broke and clashed,</p>
<p>Agamemnon lord of men and brilliant Achilles. (1.1–8)</p>
</blockquote>

During most of *The Iliad,* Achilles wrath is directed at Agamemnon because he disgraced Achilles in front of all the Greeks by stealing his concubine, Briseis.  It isn’t until book 18, when Achilles learns that Patroclus died, that his wrath is then re-directed towards Hector.

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“Then let me die at once”—</p>
<p>Achilles burst out, despairing—”since it was not my fat</p>
<p>to save my dearest comrade from his death! Look,</p>
<p>a world away from his fatherland he’s perished,</p>
<p>lacking me, my fighting strength, to defend him.</p>
<p>But now, since I shall not return to my fatherland …</p>
<p>nor did I bring one ray of hope to my Patroclus,</p>
<p>nor to the rest of all my steadfast comrades,</p>
<p>countless ranks struck down by mighty Hector—</p>
<p>No, no, here I sit by the ships …</p>
<p>a useless, dead weight on the good green earth—</p>
<p>I, no man  my equal among the bronze-armed Achaeans,</p>
<p>not in battle, only in wars of words that others win.</p>
<p>If only strife could die from the lives of gods and men</p>
<p>and anger that drives the sanest man to flare in outrage—</p>
<p>bitter gall, sweeter than dripping streams of honey,</p>
<p>that swarms in people’s chests and blinds like smoke—</p>
<p>just like the anger Agamemnon king of men</p>
<p>has roused within me now …</p>
<p>Enough.</p>
<p>Let bygones be bygones. Done is done.</p>
<p>Despite my anguish I will beat it down,</p>
<p>the fury mounting inside me, down by force.</p>
<p>But now I’ll go and meet that murderer head-on,</p>
<p>that Hector who destroyed the dearest life I know. (18.96–115)</p>
</blockquote>

And, after Achilles kills Hector, he is still not at peace.  It isn’t until King Priam, willed by Zeus, visits Achilles to ransom for Hector’s body, that Achilles’ wrath seems to subside:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Revere the gods, Achilles! Pity me in my own right,</p>
<p>remember your own father! I deserve more pity …</p>
<p>I have endured what no one on earth has ever done before—</p>
<p>I put to my lips the hands of the man who killed my son.”</p>
<br>
<p>Those words stirred within Achilles a deep desire</p>
<p>to grieve for his own father. Taking the old man’s hand</p>
<p>he gently moved him back. And overpowered by memory</p>
<p>both men gave way to grief.  Priam wept freely</p>
<p>for man-killing Hector, throbbing, crouching</p>
<p>before Achilles’ feet as Achilles wept himself,</p>
<p>now for his father, now for Patroclus once again,</p>
<p>and their sobbing rose and fell throughout the house.</p>
<p>Then, when brilliant Achilles had had his fill of tears</p>
<p>and the longing for it had left his mind and body,</p>
<p>he rose from his seat, raised the old man by the hand</p>
<p>and filled with pity now for his gray head and gray beard,</p>
<p>he spoke out winging words, flying straight to the heart:</p>
<p>“Poor man, how much you’ve born—pain to break the spirit!” (24.503–18)</p>
</blockquote>

So, *The Iliad*, is in many ways a poem about the wrath of Achilles, which is lit in Book 1 and only extinguished towards the end of Book 24.

Some interpret *The Iliad* as a poem about growth and moral progress—Achilles’ god-like wrath is humanized by Priam.  Others see Achilles’ rage and general attitude as being consistent throughout the book.

## Similes

Here are my favourite similes:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Like the generations of leaves, the lives of mortal men.</p>
<p>Now the wind scatters the old leaves across the earth,</p>
<p>now the living timber bursts with the new buds</p>
<p>and spring comes round again.  And so with men:</p>
<p>as one generation comes to life, another dies away. (6.146–9)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Both men bent on combat, on they fought like wind</p>
<p>when a god sends down some welcome blast to sailors</p>
<p>desperate for it, worked to death at the polished oars,</p>
<p>beating the heavy seas, their arms slack with the labor—</p>
<p>so welcome that brace of men appeared to the Trojans</p>
<p>desperate for their captains. (7.3–7)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>As a garden poppy, burst into red bloom, bends,</p>
<p>drooping its head to one side, weighed down</p>
<p>by its full seeds and a sudden spring shower,</p>
<p>so Gorgythion’s head fell limp over one shoulder,</p>
<p>weighed down by his helmet. (8.306-9)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Quick as a thought goes flashing through a man</p>
<p>who’s traveled the world—”Ah to be there, or there!”—</p>
<p>as his mind swarms with journeys, fresh desires—</p>
<p>so quick in her eager flight flew noble Hera now</p>
<p>and scaling steep Olympus went amount the gods. (15.79–83)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>She put fresh strength in his back, spring in his knees</p>
<p>and filled his heart with the horsefly’s raw daring—</p>
<p>brush it away from a man’s flesh and back it comes,</p>
<p>biting, attacking, crazed for sweet human blood. (17.570–3)</p>
</blockquote>
