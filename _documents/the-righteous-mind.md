## Summary


## Outline

- Intuitions come first; strategic reasoning second
  - Where does morality come from?
    - Nativist: It is innate (biology or God)
    - Empiricist: From observations or experience; taught by parents and society
    - Rationalist: Self-taught from observations, and especially that the child doesn’t like to be harmed
    - Intuitionism: Moral “tastebuds” are innate; society teaches us what “tastes good”
  - Models of the Mind
    - Plato: Reason could and should be master
    - Hume: Reason should serve the “passions”
    - Jefferson: Reason and emotions are equally good
  - Evidence that intitutions come first
  - Evidence that strategic reasoning comes second

## Questions

What is the precise difference between moral rationalism and empiricism?

Certainly the empiricist is allowed to use reason to develop their morality? Perhaps the distinction is that the empiricist believes we merely follow the patterns set by the humans around us, while the rationalist uses first-principles to derive morality.

Rationalism and empiricism would then be gradations on a spectrum. The rationalist uses observations and experience, as well as reason.

## The Rationalist Delusion

At the end of Book I, Haidt presents his most compelling arguments against the rationalist view of the mind (and moral thinking):

<blockquote>
<p>Anyone who values truth should stop worshipping reason. We all need to take a cold hard look at the evidence and see reasoning for what it is … most of the bizarre and depressing research findings make perfect sense once you see reasoning as having evolved not to help us find truth but to help us engage in arguments, persuasion, and manipulation in the context of discussions with other people … ”This explains why the confirmation bias is so powerful, and so ineradicable. How hard could it be to teach students to look on the other side, to look for evidence against their favored view? Yet, in fact, it’s very hard, and nobody has yet found a way to do it. It’s hard because the confirmation bias is a built-in feature (of an argumentative mind), not a bug that can be removed (from a platonic mind).</p>
<p>I’m not saying we should all stop reasoning and go with our gut feelings. Gut feelings are sometimes better guides than reasoning for making consumer choices and interpersonal judgments, but they are often disastrous as a basis for public policy, science, and law. Rather, what I’m saying is that we must be wary of any individual’s ability to reason. We should see each individual as being limited, like a neuron. A neuron is really good at one thing: summing up the stimulation coming into its dendrites to “decide” whether to fire a pulse along its axon. A neuron by itself isn’t very smart. But if you put neurons together in the right way you get a brain; you get an emergent system that is much smarter and more flexible than a single neuron.</p>
<p>In the same way, each individual reasoner is really good at one thing: finding evidence to support the position he or she already holds, usually for intuitive reasons. We should not expect individuals to produce good, open-minded, truth-seeking reasoning, particularly when self-interest or reputational concerns are in play. But if you put individuals together in the right way, such that some individuals can use their reasoning powers to disconfirm the claims of others, and all individuals feel some common bond or shared fate that allows them to interact civilly, you can create a group that ends up producing good reasoning as an emergent property of the social system. This is why it’s so important to have intellectual and ideological diversity within any group or institution whose goal is to find truth (such as an intelligence agency or a community of scientists) or to produce good public policy (such as a legislature or advisory board). And if our goal is to produce good behavior, not just good thinking, then it’s even more important to reject rationalism and embrace intuitionism.</p>
</blockquote>

Haidt compels us to face the limitations of the individual’s ability to reason.  I think these limitations are real.  Many of my most productive intellectual develops stem from conversations, so Haidt’s emphasis on the group tempering reason feels correct.  But even within this framework, individual reason is essential, since it must decide which external arguments are valid.  Thus, it would be contradictory for Haidt to be completely skeptical of the individual’s ability to reason.

Haidt anticipates this tension when he says:

<blockquote>
<p>I have tried to make a reasoned case that our moral capacities are best described from an intuitionist perspective. I do not claim to have examined the question from all sides, nor to have offered irrefutable proof. Because of the insurmountable power of the confirmation bias, counterarguments will have to be produced by those who disagree with me. Eventually, if the scientific community works as it is supposed to, the truth will emerge as a large number of flawed and limited minds battle it out.</p>
</blockquote>

All skeptics of reason face this contradiction when they write.

## Is vs Ought

Haidt makes a strong case that intuitions and emotion are often served by reason.

By agreeing with Hume (even while conceding that Hume went to far), he also says that reason _ought_ to serve emotions.  But why _should_ reason serve the emotions?!  It seems that Haidt, in his extended quote about groups being able to reason better than individuals, concedes that reason is superior.

## Does Education make us Moral?

I suspect it does, but why?
