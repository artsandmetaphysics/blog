A metaphysical belief is “true” when it correctly describes reality.

An epistemological belief is “true” when, if it is followed, it leads us to true metaphysical beliefs.

An epistemological belief can be true while also not being useful.

Few, if any, beliefs are certain.  We can not “prove” many beliefs.

Still, we can and do use certain rules to establish how likely or unlikely beliefs are.

It is less useful to consider individual beliefs than to consider multiple interconnected beliefs—a belief system.

We can consider whether a belief system is internally consistent—thus, in some cases, we can disprove a belief system.

If a set of beliefs is internally consistent, it may still be “wrong.”

We are free agents existing in reality.  We begin our lives without consciousness and it slowly appears.

We can not escape our existence in reality, and our metaphysical and epistemological belief system must begin somewhere; we must adopt our first epistemological beliefs without a foundation.

We can not decompose our epistemological beliefs from our metaphysical beliefs.  We are bound by reality, and the assumptions we make about reality inform how we decide what we know about reality, and vice versa.

Our brains have a limited physical extent.  Language is also limited.
