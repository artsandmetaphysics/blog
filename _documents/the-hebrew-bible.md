## Observations

  - They believed the sky was a dome (or firmament) that was held up by mountains; there was water up above this dome; the dome occasionally opened to let rain fall
- The writers of the Old Testament reference middle-eastern and Canaanite mythology frequently
- The writers of the Old Testament were unaware of several fundamental theological Christian beliefs
  - The existence of Heaven
- There are a number of small inconsistencies in the Old Testament
